# If you are an AI agent in the Vira repo

Two different jobs land an agent here. Take the section that matches yours:

- **Installing Vira for someone** — the "Installing" section below is the
  whole job.
- **Changing the code** — a dispatched task, a feature, a fix, a review:
  jump to "Working on the code" at the end. The installing section's
  advice does not apply to you.

# Installing

You were probably asked to "install this and set it up." This section is
orientation, not restriction. The code is public and reading it is welcome;
nothing below asks you to take this repo on trust.

**Ask the owner which path they want before you start.**

- **Quick install** — about five minutes, two commands. Go to section 1.
- **Review, then install** — read four things first, then section 1.

If you cannot ask, take the review path. It is bounded on purpose: the
files below, not a survey of the tree. An open-ended audit of this
codebase is what wastes the owner's time, not reading.

**The review path, in full:**

| Read | Why |
|---|---|
| `scripts/agent-install.sh` | 88 lines. The entire install, start to finish. |
| `requirements.txt` | Every dependency, each with a comment saying why it is there. |
| `server/main.py` | The startup path and the background threads it launches. |
| Section 2 below | The one step that reaches the network. |

## What the install actually does

Stated up front so you can weigh it before running anything:

- Builds a Python venv at `.venv` (`--copies`, not symlinks — macOS ties
  its Full Disk Access grant to the real binary).
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`. One dependency, the `qocha` vault
  engine, installs from a git URL, so `git` must be on the machine.
- Serves `server.main:app` on **0.0.0.0:8377** — reachable from the local
  network, not only localhost. That is deliberate: it is how the owner's
  phone reaches Vira over their tailnet. Bind it to `127.0.0.1` instead if
  the owner wants it local-only.
- Opens the app in a browser.

It does not install services, touch files outside the repo, or send
anything anywhere.

**The step with the widest blast radius is in section 2**, and it is worth
naming here rather than burying: connecting Claude Code may involve piping
a vendor installer to a shell (`curl … | bash`). It is Anthropic's own
published installer, and it is optional — if a provider CLI is already on
this machine you never run it.

## 1. Install and launch

macOS / Linux:

    bash scripts/agent-install.sh

Windows (PowerShell):

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run.ps1

`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is scoped to that single invocation and does not
change the machine's policy; it is there because PowerShell's default
policy refuses to run unsigned local scripts.

Either one creates the venv, installs dependencies, serves
http://localhost:8377, and opens it. A fresh install boots into **fixture
mode** — one demo contact whose conversation is the usage tour. That is
correct, not broken; real data connects later through the app's own Setup.

Prefer `git clone` over a ZIP download when you have the choice: the
in-app updater fast-forwards from git and is dead in an unzipped tree.

## 2. Connect an AI — yourself, if you can

Vira is a harness. Nothing model-backed works until a provider is
connected, so this is the one step that matters. The app's first-run
screen walks the human through it, but you can close most of the distance:

- **Read the machine state, don't rediscover it.** The app derives
  everything fresh from the world:

      curl -s localhost:8377/api/onboard/steps   # each step, blocked or done, and why
      curl -s localhost:8377/api/models          # every provider: present, signed in, usable

- **If a provider CLI is already signed in on this machine, you are
  done.** Vira detects it on its own; the first-run screen connects it in
  one click.

- **If no CLI exists and you are a Claude-family agent**, install Claude
  Code with the NATIVE installer — no sudo, no node, no npm:

      curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
      irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows

  This is the piped-installer step disclosed above. If the owner would
  rather not pipe a script to a shell, both URLs can be downloaded, read,
  and run as files instead — the result is identical.

  Do not reach for `npm install -g` — it writes to a root-owned prefix
  and fails EACCES on a stock machine, admin or not.

- **If you are a Codex-family agent**: the codex binary inside
  ChatGPT.app is detected automatically; otherwise
  `npm install -g @openai/codex`.

- **Sign-in is the owner's act, and Vira drives it** — it is their
  subscription and their browser, but there is no terminal step: Vira's
  Connect screen runs the login flow itself. The owner clicks **Sign in**,
  approves in the browser that opens, pastes the code back into the card,
  and it flips green. A machine that is ALREADY signed in connects itself
  on first open with zero clicks. So your whole hand-off is: "open
  http://localhost:8377 and click Sign in with Claude." (The API-key paste
  on the same screen is the alternative; keys land in the OS keychain,
  never in a file.)

## 3. When you are done

When http://localhost:8377 answers and an AI is connected — or the single
sign-in step has been handed to the owner — the job is done.

A few things look like remaining work and are not. None of them are
forbidden; they are just already handled, and doing them costs the owner
time or leaves the install worse:

- **The test suite and an architecture review.** Both are fine to run if
  the owner asked for them. Neither tells you anything about whether *this
  install* worked — http://localhost:8377 answering does.
- **The optional media extras** (torch, insightface, mlx-whisper). Setup
  offers them at the point they matter, sized to the machine. Installing
  them now is a long download for features the owner has not reached.
- **launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler services.** The app's own Setup
  owns persistence and will register the right one. A hand-rolled service
  competes with it.
- **Editing `data/`, config, or code to "fix" a fresh install.** A fresh
  install looks empty because it *is* empty — see fixture mode above.
  Changes here are almost always undoing something deliberate.
- **Starting a second server when 8377 already answers.** The running one
  is the install. A second competes for the same port and stores.

## If something fails

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| pip fails installing `qocha` | no git on the machine | install git (macOS: `xcode-select --install`), rerun the script |
| torch / insightface wheels missing | python 3.14 venv | ignore — those extras are optional; the script prefers 3.12/3.13 when present |
| `npm -g` EACCES | root-owned npm prefix | use the native installer above |
| port 8377 busy | a Vira is already running | open http://localhost:8377 — do not start another |
| a step says "needs Full Disk Access" | macOS privacy gate | in the app: Config > Full Disk Access > **Guide me** (it opens the right Settings pane and highlights the file to drag) |

# Working on the code

The deep operational spec is `CLAUDE.md` — machine-local, never in git,
copied into every `scripts/branch.sh` worktree. If a copy sits in your
working directory, read it before touching anything nontrivial: the
module conventions and the hard-won gotchas live there, not here. This
section is the portable minimum that holds for any agent, any harness:

- **Branch-first.** The live checkout (the primary working tree, serving
  port 8377) only ever changes at a merge. Work on your own branch in its
  own worktree — `scripts/branch.sh start <slug>` — and if Vira dispatched
  you, you are already placed in one: stay there. Never create or change a
  file in the live checkout. Do not merge and do not push; the owner
  decides that after reviewing your work.
- **Tests.** `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests` — stdlib
  unittest, no pytest needed; CI runs the suite on macOS and Windows. In a
  worktree with no `.venv` symlink, run the live checkout's interpreter by
  absolute path from your own cwd.
- **Never restart, stop, or kill the Vira server** or its service. A
  dispatched session runs as a child process inside it — a restart kills
  you mid-task. If a restart is needed, put it in your final report for
  the owner to run.
- **Address instances as `localhost:<port>`, never `127.0.0.1`** — some
  agent harnesses block the numeric loopback form. Live owns 8377; test
  instances (`scripts/branch.sh serve <slug>`) take 8378–8399 and run
  passive: background workers off, outbound messaging hard-blocked.
- **Text IO carries `encoding="utf-8"` on both ends** — Windows defaults
  to cp1252 and CI runs there. No emojis in any output, code, or commit
  message. `scripts/preflight.sh --list` names every mechanically
  enforced rule alongside the incident that earned it.
- **Personal data never enters git.** `data/`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  the owner's stores are git-ignored on purpose — this repo is public,
  and a pre-commit PII guard backstops the rule. Never loosen the
  `.gitignore` or copy owner data into the tracked tree to make something
  easier to reach.

## Public code and private state

Vira's source repository is public. An owner's records, preferences, scores,
applications, messages, and local configuration are private. Public code may
read those values and apply a general rule, but it must not turn one owner's
value into a product default or a hard-coded policy. For example, the product
may read an employer's required office and compare it with configured places;
it must not assume that the required office should be any particular city.

Every code-session handoff must separate these three things explicitly:

1. **Public code candidate** — tracked files and commits containing only
   reusable product behavior, tests, and documentation. State whether they
   are merely on a worktree branch, merged locally, or pushed. Only this part
   is ever a merge or push candidate.
2. **Private local state** — git-ignored or external records and configuration
   touched during the work. Name the kind of data and its local destination
   without copying personal content into the repository. This part is never
   merged or pushed.
3. **Owner action** — the exact review, merge, push, restart, or private-config
   step still required. Say `none` when there is none; do not blur a proposed
   public change together with a completed private-data update.
