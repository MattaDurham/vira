# clone_data <src-data-dir> <dst-data-dir>
#
# An instant APFS clone of live data. Disposable; never shared. The source is
# a RUNNING server, so it churns while the copy walks it — three rules keep
# that from killing the clone:
#
#   - sqlite sidecars (-shm/-wal) are never copied. They appear and vanish as
#     the server checkpoints (a vanished media-index.sqlite-wal used to abort
#     the whole script under `set -e`), they rebuild themselves on open, and
#     pairing a mid-transaction WAL with a separately-copied database would
#     make the snapshot less consistent, not more.
#   - every other top-level entry is copied on its own, so one entry's churn
#     can't truncate the walk. A copy error is fatal only if the source still
#     exists; an entry that disappeared mid-clone was transient and simply
#     isn't part of this point-in-time snapshot.
#   - the snapshot is built in a staging directory and moved into place in a
#     single rename, so a failure can never leave a half-copied data/ behind
#     for the next serve to trip over.
#
# The .test-snapshot marker is written last, inside the stage: it distinguishes
# a real snapshot from a stray data/ created by module imports (e.g. running
# the test suite), and it only ever appears on a complete clone.

# local merge gate stays the door. `pr` pushes the branch and opens a draft PR
# with a written body; `merge` then runs exactly as before, and because merges
# are --no-ff, pushing main flips the PR to Merged on its own. `discard`
# closes an open PR without merging, so a rejected experiment keeps its diff
# and write-up as the record. Everything here except cmd_pr itself is
# BEST-EFFORT: a GitHub nicety must never wedge or fail a finished merge.
