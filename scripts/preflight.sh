# Preflight — the executable form of what CLAUDE.md used to only ask for.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every process failure this repo has had was the same
# shape: a check existed but was weaker than it looked, and its failure
# reached nobody. The response each time was another paragraph of prose,
# which a session may or may not read and which nothing enforces. This file
# is the alternative: a lesson is encoded as a CHECK — a function that runs,
# names the incident that earned it, and prints the exact fix.
#
# ADDING A LESSON IS ADDING A ROW. Append the id to CHECKS, then write
# desc_<id>, incident_<id>, fix_<id>, and check_<id>. Nothing else. That is
# the whole point: the mechanism for encoding a lesson is cheap and uniform,
# so the process gets stronger instead of accumulating patches.
#
# A check must be CHEAP, DETERMINISTIC, and print a FIX. A check that cannot
# say what to do about a failure is a complaint, not a check.
#
# RATCHETS. Some debt is pre-existing and too large to fix in one go. Those
# checks compare against a baseline count in preflight-baseline.txt and fail
# only when the count RISES. Existing debt is tolerated; new debt is not, and
# the baseline is lowered as it gets paid down. A ratchet never has to be
# argued about in review.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/preflight.sh --list              what is checked, and why
#   scripts/preflight.sh --all               everything (CI, publication audits)
#   scripts/preflight.sh --pre-merge [slug]  the gate branch.sh merge runs
#   scripts/preflight.sh <id> [<id>...]      one or more by name
