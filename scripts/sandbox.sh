# Vira sandbox: a stranger's first ten minutes, on your own Mac.
#
# Clones the PUBLIC repo into ~/vira-sandbox/app, builds its own venv from
# requirements.txt, and runs it against a FAKE HOME (~/vira-sandbox/home) so
# the app sees an empty machine: no contacts, no messages, no calendar, no
# skills library, no backups of yours. Reset wipes it back to virgin.
#
#   sandbox.sh new [--force]      clone + venv + empty home (a virgin install)
#   sandbox.sh serve [--demo]     run it on :8400 (a real first boot)
#                                 --demo stubs the calls that escape to the
#                                 real OS (browser sign-in, System Settings),
#                                 so onboarding can be walked end to end
#   sandbox.sh replay [--demo]    back to the FIRST SCREEN on the LATEST code,
#                                 no re-provision: fast-forwards the clone,
#                                 wipes data/ (incl. the once-per-install
#                                 welcome flag) and serves. Keeps venv + login.
#   sandbox.sh stop
#   sandbox.sh status
#   sandbox.sh login              log the claude CLI in for the sandbox home
#                                 (interactive, once — see MODEL BACKEND below)
#   sandbox.sh expose <what>      lend the sandbox a real store, read-only-ish:
#                                   contacts | messages | calendar | photos | all
#   sandbox.sh unexpose           take them all back
#   sandbox.sh reset [--force]    wipe and re-provision from scratch
#   sandbox.sh supervise [--demo] (internal) the relaunch loop `serve` starts —
#                                 runs uvicorn, performs any maintenance the
#                                 app queued, starts it again. See SUPERVISOR.
#
# SUPERVISOR: `serve` does not run uvicorn directly — it starts a relaunch
# loop (the scripts/run.ps1 -Serve pattern), so the sandbox has what every
# other Vira install has: something that brings it back after a deliberate
# exit. That is what makes the app's own "Reset to a new user" button able
# to pull the latest code and hand back a genuinely virgin install: the
# server does the git work, queues the wipe in a file the loop reads, and
# exits. Wiping data/ from INSIDE the process that holds those sqlite files
# open is the one thing this arrangement avoids. The queue path rides
# VIRA_SANDBOX_LOOP, which is also how update.supervisor() knows a loop is
# watching (an unsupervised sandbox refuses the restart instead).
#
# WHY THE FAKE HOME: Path.home() follows $HOME, and every machine-level
# store Vira reads hangs off it — ~/Library/Messages/chat.db, AddressBook,
# Calendar, Photos, ~/.claude (the skills library), ~/.vira-backups. One
# env var isolates all of them. What it CANNOT isolate is the login
# Keychain, which is machine-wide: that is why the sandbox launches with
# VIRA_KEYCHAIN_PREFIX, so it can never read the live instance's Mercury
# token or overwrite its Graph refresh token (see settings.keychain_service).
#
# MODEL BACKEND: the claude CLI tracks which account it is signed in as per
# config directory, so under the fake HOME it reports logged out — which is
# exactly the state a new user is in before they sign in, and Vira's health
# watcher says so in the header. Anything model-backed (reply drafts, the
# brief narrative, dossier building, agent sessions) stays dark until you
# run `sandbox.sh login` once. That login refreshes the same Keychain
# credential the live instance already uses — same account, so live is
# unaffected.
#
# Not to be confused with scripts/branch.sh — that serves YOUR data from a
# feature branch to test a change. This serves NOTHING of yours, to test
# the install.

set -eu

# $0 inside a zsh function is the FUNCTION name, so the header has to be
# read from a path captured at file scope.
