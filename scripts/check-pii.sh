# Pre-commit PII guard: blocks a commit whose staged additions contain
# personal data. Two pattern sources:
#   1. Generic built-ins below (phones, home paths, personal-email domains).
#   2. data/pii-patterns.txt — one extended-regex per line, # comments —
#      holding THIS instance's real identifiers (names, tenant, numbers).
#      It is git-ignored, so the guard itself never leaks what it guards.
# Install via scripts/install-hooks.sh (or: ln -s ../../scripts/check-pii.sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit). Bypass for a false positive: git commit --no-verify.
