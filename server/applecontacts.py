"""Apple Contacts write-back — the Apple spoke of the CRM sync engine.

Contact-card saves flow through to the matching card(s) in macOS
Contacts.app, which iCloud/CardDAV-syncs to the owner's phone — so an
edit made in Vira is an edit made everywhere, not an edit made in one
database the phone never reads (the gap that prompted this, 2026-07-24: a
contact's employer was corrected in Vira while their phone card kept the
old one).

Design per the 2026-07-22 engine session: the CRM is the hub and owns
every field; this module is the Apple SPOKE — AppleScript against
Contacts.app, never raw abcddb writes. The June 2026 dedup campaign
proved the mechanism (crm/scripts/dedup_apply.py: person-id addressing,
make-new-email, set-organization, save).

What it pushes: company, birthday, and the email/phone lists — ORDER
and LABELS. The order is the card's rank made visible: primary first,
archived last wearing an "old" label; `use` maps personal->home,
work->work. What it never does: DELETE an address that exists only on
the Apple card (deletes never auto-propagate — the engine rule), touch
the note or the photo, or create a card — push targets existing matched
cards only, and a person with no Apple card is simply not pushed.

Matching: the AddressBook sqlite stores are scanned read-only (the
photos.py discovery pattern); a card matches when it shares a
normalized handle with the person. Every matched card gets the same
push, so a person carded in several stores stays consistent in the
unified view the phone renders.

Gotchas, learned live 2026-07-24:
- Contacts.app must be RUNNING. `tell application "Contacts"` from a
  sandboxed server context cannot auto-launch it (error -600);
  _ensure_running uses `open -g -j -a Contacts` (background, hidden)
  and retries once.
- Birthdays are assembled from date components (set year/month/day on
  a `current date` copy) — `date "..."` string literals parse by the
  system locale and are not portable across machines.
- Email/phone REORDERING is a full rewrite of the list (delete every
  entry, re-add in order). That is why the plan is computed as a pure
  union first — the rewrite must re-add every Apple-side address, or a
  reorder would silently become a delete.
