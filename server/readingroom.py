"""Reading rooms — the validated write behind the Reader, store-native.

A room is a researched consumption queue: every worthwhile talk, paper,
post, and episode on one subject, ranked and deduplicated. The research
is a model's job; the DATA is not. An agent session proposes a payload
through the native `create_reading_room` tool (server/viratools.py), and
everything that touches disk happens here, behind a schema. Same
discipline as update_module_map — the agent proposes, the server
validates and applies.

THE STORE IS THE ROOM (owner's call, 2026-07-27). The first design made
each room a generated standalone HTML page, and every problem the owner
hit was that one fact wearing different costumes: an iframe document
inherits nothing from the app (the white-scrollbar bug, skins not
reaching rooms), items trapped in HTML are invisible to search and the
vault, counting them meant regexing a 200KB page, and updating meant
regenerating a file with no clean diff to notify on. So a room now lives
at data/reading/rooms/<slug>.json and the Reader renders it NATIVELY —
one implementation, wearing whatever skin the app wears. The standalone
page survives as an EXPORT (`export_html`, served on demand at
/reading/<slug>.html): shareable, readable outside Vira, never the
source of truth.

Stable ids are the other reason to centralize this. An item's id is
derived from its URL (or its title when it has none), so REBUILDING a
room — a wider repass, a fresh sweep months later — keeps every done-mark
the owner has earned (done-marks stay in reading.py's per-slug store,
keyed by the same slug). Ids the model invents would not survive that.

THE SKILL THAT BUILDS A ROOM is fully specified and topic-agnostic:
frontdoor's reader module carries the interview (subject / why / modes /
depth / people) and `frontdoor._reader_prompt` composes the research
method — vault-aware sweep, primary sources, honest P1-P3 ranking —
ending in one `create_reading_room` call. "Pop in another topic" is that
same interview, reachable from the Reader shelf's New-room card.
`update_prompt` is the standing-refresh half; the weekly room-scout
routine dispatches it for every room, and `build()` pings the owner when
a rebuild lands new items (the applications-module watch pattern).
