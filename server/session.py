"""Live two-way agent sessions — durable, detached, steerable.

Since the durable-runner build, every SDK job runs OUTSIDE the server as
its own detached process (server/runner.py, its own process group), so a
Vira restart no longer kills running jobs. This module is the supervisor
side of that split:

- launch: write the job dir (data/jobs/<id>/job.json), record the ledger
  launch row, spawn the runner detached, register a handle.
- observe: snapshots are assembled from the runner's state.json +
  output.log tail — the same legacy /api/jobs/{id} shape as ever (plus
  mode/awaiting/live/pending). A supervisor thread polls active job dirs,
  fans SSE pokes to the UI, and finalizes any runner that died without
  writing a finish (stale heartbeat + dead pid -> "orphaned").
- steer: say / permission / interrupt / close append command lines to the
  job's control.jsonl; the runner tails it. Because the whole exchange is
  file-based, a server booted AFTER the runner started re-attaches and
  keeps steering — permission cards survive restarts too.
- re-attach: at boot the supervisor scans data/jobs for state.json files
  still "running": live runners (fresh heartbeat or live pid) are
  re-registered as running sessions; dead ones are finalized. Only then is
  the joblog orphan sweep run, scoped to records with no live runner.

The permission gate, transcript rendering, and plan publishing live in the
runner now. If the SDK is not importable the registry falls back to the
legacy in-server subprocess --print path (steering and gating disabled,
loudly noted in the transcript) — the app never fails to boot because of
the SDK.

        looking at is a session quietly stalled, which is the failure the

        this server supervises can be answered (permission/answer both go
        through _require_live), and a card that cannot be actioned is worse
        than no card at all.

        state.json is read FRESH rather than off `last_state` — the cached
        copy is refreshed by the supervisor, which does not run on a passive

        side-effect free (it does NOT touch `last_state`): the supervisor
        detects status transitions by comparing its cached status against a
        fresh read, so refreshing the cache from here could swallow the
