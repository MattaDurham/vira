"""Server-persisted UI state — the desktop window arrangement.

The desktop layout (floating-window positions/sizes/zoom/open state, dock
icon order) historically lived only in browser localStorage, which is
per-origin: a test instance on 127.0.0.1:83xx, the Tailscale hostname, or
a second browser all opened with default window placement, never the
owner's arrangement. This store mirrors the whitelisted localStorage keys
into data/ui-state.json — which rides the APFS data clone that
`branch.sh serve` makes — so a fresh origin adopts the live look at boot.

Sync model (client side, app.js syncUiState): LOCAL WINS on a browser
that already has its own saved layout — it keeps it and mirrors changes
up (so the store converges to the most recently used desktop browser,
i.e. the owner's). A fresh origin adopts the server copy at boot. No
timestamps, no merge: last writer wins, which is correct for a
single-owner arrangement.

Values are stored as the OPAQUE localStorage strings (validated to be
JSON) — no re-encoding seam between what the browser wrote and what it
reads back.
