"""Change log — every shipped change per session, all the way back to the
first Vira session.

The per-session record already exists as the Vira session retros in
`~/TC-IL/Sessions/* vira.md` (each retro's `## Shipped` section is that
session's changes), so the change log is DERIVED from them at read time —
no parallel store to keep in sync, and it always reaches back to the
beginning. Resolved backlog items from the ideas store (status done /
dropped) are folded in too, so marking an idea done/dropped in the Ideas
tab shows up here immediately (under its session date, or a "recent /
unfiled" bucket until close-session writes that session's retro).

Claude jobs launched through Vira (Plan / Implement / cockpit runs) fold in
the same way from the durable job ledger (server/joblog.py) — prompt head,
target repo, outcome, and the claude session id that names the on-disk
transcript — so every agent-driven change is on the record even after the
in-memory jobs list is gone.

PROJECT-SCOPED (2026-07-12): this change log is Vira's only. The ideas
store and the job ledger both carry cross-project entries (ideas have a
`project` field; jobs run against any target repo), so both are filtered
before folding in — ideas to `project == "Vira"`, jobs to those that ran
in the Vira checkout or were dispatched from a Vira-project idea. Other
projects get their own changelogs in their own homes; nothing foreign
lands here.

Read-only: `GET /api/changelog` → { groups: [ {date, time, goal, entries:
[{text, kind}]} ] }, newest first. kind ∈ {ship, done, dropped, job}.
A kind-"job" entry also carries `job_id` (the full ledger id) so a client
rendering the ledger BESIDE the changelog — the Work window's merged
Record stream — can drop the changelog's copy of a job it is already
showing as a ledger row, instead of rendering one job twice.
