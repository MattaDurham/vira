"""AI-backend health — the deterministic self-check that keeps an AI product
survivable when its own model auth fails.

The governing principle: troubleshooting infrastructure must never depend on
the thing it troubleshoots. When the Claude login expires, the LLM is exactly
what is unreachable — so detection, classification, the fallback decision, and
the owner alert are all plain Python + shell + the iMessage notify path. None
of them touch the model. This is the four-rung insurance the rest of Vira's
"everything that can be deterministic is" philosophy implies:

  1. probe()             is the AI backend authenticated and reachable? (green/red)
  2. classify(text)      map a raw auth failure to a friendly, actionable state
                         (never leak a stack trace; the caller never loses work)
  3. preferred_backend() the fallback ladder — a dead CLI login with a
                         VIRA_ANTHROPIC_KEY present routes to the API instead
  4. Watcher             a daemon that probes on a cadence and pings the owner
                         over iMessage on the green->red edge, so a silently
                         dead cockpit job never recurs

Single-tenant by design: one instance, one owner, their own login. The owner
IS the admin, so "notify + guide the human to re-login" fully closes the loop —
which is exactly why a personal-login deployment is viable rather than a
compromise. In a shared-key deployment the same probe still detects; only the
remediation channel changes (page on-call instead of text the owner).

Why no proactive "your token expires in N days" rung: the Max-plan OAuth
access token is short-lived and auto-refreshed hourly, so warning on it would
false-alarm constantly; the thing that actually lapses is the refresh token,
whose expiry `claude auth status` does not expose. The honest proactive signal
is instead the fast cadence probe catching loggedIn=false within one interval
of the refresh dying — before the owner ever discovers it via a dead job.

The probe is cheap and spends no tokens: `claude auth status` reports the
login state directly, and an API key is validated with a free GET /v1/models.
