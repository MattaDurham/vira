"""Module front doors — the path from a dormant module to a live one.

A module whose config is absent is DORMANT: the code works, it simply has
nothing to show. That is a good failure mode and a dead end. The Reader
took it furthest — with no pages on disk it deleted its own dock icon and
skipped itself in the Launchpad grid, so the one surface where a stranger
could have discovered the module was the one surface that refused to show
it. Applications did the softer version: always visible, always empty,
with no hint that a config key stood between the two states.

A front door replaces the dead end. Every setup-able module declares:

  - `blurb`  — what it is, in one line a stranger understands
  - `what`   — the longer answer behind "What is this?"
  - `ask`    — the interview that collects what setup needs
  - `probe`  — whether the module is live yet, derived from the world

`state()` reports every module's readiness the way onboard.steps() does:
DERIVED, never stored. A half-finished setup recomputes exactly where it
stopped, so re-entry is free and no progress file can go stale against
reality.

The write boundary, stated once because it is the security-relevant part:

  - CONFIG goes through a server-side validator. The interview's answers
    compose a prompt; the session proposes a config payload through a
    native tool (server/viratools.py); this module schema-checks it and
    applies it. A bad config breaks the app for every module, so the
    agent never writes one by its own hands — the update_module_map
    discipline, applied to setup.
  - CONTENT is authored normally, inside the directory the owner named
    during the interview (a self-record, a reading room). That is the
    agent doing the job it was dispatched to do, in a place the owner
    chose, and validating prose through a schema would buy nothing.

Store: data/frontdoor.json — which setups have been dispatched, and the
job id of each, so a front door can show a run in flight and link to it.
