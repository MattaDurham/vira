"""Shared channel mechanics: the pieces every inbound-channel connector
(mail, M365 Graph, WhatsApp, the Android companion) was carrying
privately.

Plain functions, not a class hierarchy — each connector keeps its own
watcher/poll shape and calls in with its own handles:

  push_feed_item     the ONE live-feed push contract (was mail.py
                     _push_item's tail, whatsapp._push,
                     companion._push_feed)
  first_run_baseline the first-poll contract: no watermark yet ->
                     baseline at the newest existing item, emit
                     NOTHING old
  imap_newest_uid    the STATUS UIDNEXT probe both IMAP baselines used
  graph_newest_received  the Graph top-1 probe both Graph baselines used
  mail_accounts /    the tolerant mail-accounts.json reader (+ the
  graph_accounts     graph-only filter brief.py wants)
  imap_special_folder  the RFC 6154 special-use mailbox finder
                     (\\Drafts for mail.py, \\All for mailindex.py)

Nothing here talks to the network on import; graph_newest_received
lazy-imports msgraph so channels stays dependency-light.
