"""The brief journal: knowledge the owner types INTO the Daily Brief.

The brief was read-only — everything on it derived from stores the owner
could not touch without clicking into each person. This module is the
write path: the owner recounts what he knows ("dinner with Chris finally
happened", "Sarah's baby is due in September", "I paid Mark back") and it
is (1) saved verbatim to data/brief-journal.json immediately — durable no
matter what — then (2) integrated by one background AI pass that maps the
note onto the CRM: closing the open loops it resolves, appending facts to
the right profiles (stamped source:"vira" so profile refreshes preserve
them — see crm/scripts/synthesize_profiles.py VIRA_EDITABLE), and
recording new commitments as loops. Recent entries also ride into the
brief's compose payload, so the next narrative generation knows what the
owner said. Every applied action is recorded on the entry in plain
English — Vira never silently edits the CRM.

Model-guessed person mappings are verified deterministically against
ground truth (CRM registry, profiles, enrichment verdicts, the person's
recent chat.db messages) before anything is written or handed downstream
— see _pid_checker. A guess nothing supports is corrected or visibly
held, never emitted as fact.

Cross-process discipline matches the other JSON stores (fresh reads,
fcntl-locked mutations, atomic writes); integration runs on a daemon
thread so the POST returns instantly.

INTEGRATE_PROMPT = """You are Vira, {owner}'s chief of staff. {owner} just \
typed a note into his daily brief — knowledge from his own head that you \
must map onto his CRM. Today is {date}.

{owner}'s note:
"{text}"
{scope}
People roster (name -> person_id) for resolving mentions:
{roster}

Currently-open loops (pending items between {owner} and people):
{loops}

Return STRICT JSON only, no prose around it:
{{
 "loop_actions": [{{"person_id": "...", "match_what": "<copy a listed loop's \
what EXACTLY>", "action": "close"}} or {{"person_id": "...", "match_what": \
"...", "action": "edit", "new_what": "..."}}],
 "new_loops": [{{"person_id": "...", "what": "...", "owed_by": "me" or "them"}}],
 "facts": [{{"person_id": "...", "fact": "<durable fact worth remembering>"}}],
 "unapplied": [{{"instruction": "<one precise, self-contained imperative \
instruction>", "area": "<what it touches: contacts, calendar, config, app, \
data, question, other>"}}],
 "summary": "<one plain sentence: what you extracted and did>"
}}

Rules:
- close a loop when the note says it happened, was resolved, or no longer
  matters; edit when the note updates its state but it stays open.
- match_what must be byte-for-byte one of the listed loops' texts.
- use ONLY person_ids present in the roster or the loops list. If a mention
  cannot be resolved, skip it and say so in summary.
- facts are durable knowledge about a person (life events, preferences,
  plans), phrased in third person. Not tasks, not the note itself.
- unapplied is for anything the note asks that the actions above CANNOT
  express — merging or splitting contacts, correcting a calendar/overlap
  judgment, changing Vira's configuration or behavior, fixing data outside
  loops and facts. Encode each as one instruction an agent with full access
  could execute later, carrying every specific the note gives (names, dates,
  which event, which contact). Never silently drop such a request.
- a QUESTION — the owner asking Vira to find, show, look up or pull up
  something from his own records ("show me the card Casey texted me") — is
  area "question". It is a lookup, not a change: encode it as the question
  itself, never as work for an agent to do.
- "(unidentified)" roster entries are placeholder contacts awaiting a name.
  Never assume one of them is the company or sender the note mentions —
  picking one is a guess that lands knowledge on the wrong real person.
- when the note describes a message from a company or automated sender (a
  bank, a service, a notification), do not map it onto a roster person
  unless that person's entry plainly IS that company; describe it in
  unapplied without a person_id instead.
- never invent anything the note does not say. If nothing is actionable,
  return empty arrays and summarize the note as saved.

# ---------- staging: an instruction becomes queued work ----------
# Until 2026-08-04 an unapplied instruction's ONLY exit was the clipboard:
# the owner copied a prompt and pasted it into a session he opened himself.
# That shape was his own 2026-07-16 spec ("encoded as a prompt that I can
# copy as an export feature, similar to my annotate"), written when a
# dispatched session was not yet trusted to finish. It has since been, and
# the asymmetry it left behind was arbitrary: the integration pass's other
# three channels — close a loop, edit a loop, write a fact — ALREADY write
# the CRM with no gate at all, so the channel that could not be expressed
# as a loop or a fact was the one carrying the HARDER gate.
#
# So an instruction is queued work now. It is staged as an idea, which is
# where every other piece of work in this app already lives — inheriting
# the Queue's approval bar, its tags, its similarity and its dispatch
# machinery rather than growing a second, weaker copy of all four.
#
# THE SPLIT IS BLAST RADIUS, NOT "deterministic vs needs code". The Vira
# repo is the better-protected target: branch-first placement, a worktree,
# a diff, a revert, the write guard, a test suite. The CRM has no git at
# all — its protection is people.json's backup and (since the same day, in
# data._backup_profile) the profile snapshot that made this list safe to
# widen. Areas outside both — a calendar judgment, an "other" — still want
# the owner's eye, so they stage as `proposed` and wait behind the
# approval bar instead of dispatching.

# A QUESTION IS NOT WORK. "Show me the insurance card that Casey texted me"

# beat the AI route), the pass could not express a lookup as a loop or a
# fact and emitted it as an `unapplied` instruction in area `data`, and
# _stage_one dispatched a coding session to "search the messages and show
# it to Matt" — which a detached session cannot do, and which grepped the
# codebase for an hour before printing a file path. The answer was one
# call away in find.ask the whole time. So a question is REDIRECTED: the
# instruction is stamped `redirect: "ask"` and resolved (it never becomes
# an idea, never dispatches, never sits in the Queue lane), and the client
# that is watching the note opens Find on the owner's OWN words — the
# note, not the model's paraphrase of it. Two independent tests decide it,
# because the model's area tag is one reading and the note is ground
# truth: the model may say `question`, and the note's own shape says it

# ---------- resolving unapplied instructions ----------
# An unapplied instruction is a "needs a session" item Vira could not apply
# automatically — it rides the Queue lane until the owner hands it to a
# full-access session and does the work. There is no automatic loop back
# from a copy-out session, so the owner marks it done here: the instruction
# is stamped resolved (kept on the entry, so the Journal window still
# chronicles it as complete) and drops off the Queue lane and the export.
# Instructions carry no id, so a single one is addressed by entry id + its
# exact text — the same key-by-content the loop actions use for open loops.
