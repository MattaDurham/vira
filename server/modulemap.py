"""The system map — a living registry of every Vira module.

One structured record per module: what it is, what it does, what it
reads and feeds, and (for the ask/search surfaces) which corpus it
answers from. The Modules page of the system atlas
(static/explainer/modules.html) renders this registry live, so the map
is only ever as stale as the registry — never as stale as a frozen
diagram export.

Two halves, per the house rule that everything deterministic stays
deterministic:

  - DERIVED AT READ TIME: `payload()` returns the registry plus the
    recent Vira-scoped change log, each entry keyword-tagged with the
    modules it touches. No sync step; the "what changed" rail is always
    current.
  - AI-REFRESHED: the module descriptions themselves drift as the app
    grows. `refresh_prompt()` composes a job (dispatched by the weekly
    "System map" routine, or POST /api/map/refresh) that reads the
    recent change log and rewrites the registry via the native
    `update_module_map` session tool — the write is validated and
    applied server-side (viratools.py), never by the agent's own hands.

Store: data/modules.json (instance copy, routine-editable, backed by
the seed below on first read). The seed ships with the code so a fresh
clone gets a correct-as-of-last-commit map.
