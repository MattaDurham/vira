"""Durable job ledger — every claude job Vira launches, recorded on disk.

data/jobs-log.json gets a record at launch, the claude session id as soon
as the CLI's init event names it (which makes the on-disk transcript at
~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session>.jsonl findable ever after), and the
outcome at finish. Since the durable-runner build, jobs run as DETACHED
processes (server/runner.py) that outlive the server — so this module is
written for cross-process use: no in-memory cache (every operation re-reads
the store), and mutations serialize through an fcntl file lock
(server/filelock.py). The server writes the launch record; the runner
writes the session id and the finish; the supervisor writes orphan marks.

Orphan sweeping is NO LONGER automatic at import time — a runner process
imports this module too, and an import-time sweep would have marked every
other live job orphaned. The server's session supervisor calls
sweep_orphans(alive) at boot with the set of job ids it actually
re-attached to; only running records outside that set are dead.

The change log (server/changelog.py) folds these records in per date, so
every job — initial prompt, session id, outcome — shows in the Change log
tab alongside shipped work and resolved ideas. The Jobs window's History
tab renders them directly (GET /api/jobs/history).

Every record is named at launch (the Job naming section below — formerly
server/jobtitle.py): `command` is the immutable human first-command line
the terminal echoes, `title` is the short, editable session name used
everywhere the job appears (title bar, Jobs list, change log, retro).
set_title() overwrites `title` on an owner edit; `command` never changes.
The two strings derive from the launch record alone (no model call — a
job is named the instant it starts): idea dispatches read as the idea,
routine runs as the routine, right-click asks quote the owner's question,
machine-composed agent prompts name themselves by their "You are …" role,
and the triple-quoted block Vira's idea/ask prompts wrap the human text
in is the primary signal.

Record shape:
  { "id": job id, "session_id": claude session id ("" until init arrives),
    "transcript": absolute path to the CLI's session jsonl ("" until known),
    "prompt": full initial prompt, "cwd": str, "model": str|None,
