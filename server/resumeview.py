"""The resume viewport — an application document you can read, question, and
annotate, with the annotations outliving the draft they were written against.

The Applications module could dispatch a package build and could map its
requirements, but it could never SHOW you the resume.  The Map reads the same
package folder (`applicationmap._read_artifact`) and flattens it into graph
units — deliberately, because a map is not a document: it keeps only the lines
relevant to a requirement, capped at 44.  This module renders the whole thing
in order, so the owner can walk someone through it.

WHY THE ROOT .docx AND NOT THE FROZEN V<N>/ SOURCE.  The package layout puts
the current round's Word copies in the package ROOT and the markdown/PDF
record in `V<N>/`, and the root copies are the ones the owner edits by hand.
Rendering the frozen source would show him a document that is not the one he
has been working on, so `applicationmap._read_artifact`'s existing preference
(root globs first, version folder second) is inherited rather than overridden.

WHY TERMS ARE THE FIRST-CLASS ANCHOR.  A package is rebuilt at every version
bump, so a note pinned to a sentence dies exactly when the owner has done the
most work — the redraft.  A term ("orchestration", "throughput") survives a
rewording; a specific bullet does not.  So a term bubble is keyed by the term
itself and is durable by construction, while a LINE note carries the text it
was written against and degrades honestly (`stale`, with the old wording shown)
rather than silently re-anchoring to a sentence that now says something else.

WHY THE GLOSS IS GLOBAL WITH A PER-ROLE OVERRIDE.  Walking through the twelfth
resume must not start from zero, so what the owner works out about a term
becomes the default everywhere; where one employer needs a different angle the
role's own note wins.  Same overlay shape as `contactcard.py`: the durable
layer underneath, the specific correction on top, and clearing the override
falls back rather than deleting.

WHAT THIS MODULE NEVER DOES.  It does not write the self-record.  A claim about
the owner's career is governed by the Master History endnotes (the claim gate),
and Vira does not author those — `feedback()` routes a broader note to the
brief journal, whose integration pass and unapplied-instruction staging already
carry that work to a session under the gate.  Job-specific feedback lands
deterministically in the role's own owner state, which is backed up and which
`apply_prompt` already feeds back into the next build.

    THE OBVIOUS METRIC IS INVERTED HERE, which is why this does not reuse
    `applicationmap.similarity`.  That score divides shared tokens by
    sqrt(len(a) * len(b)), so it PENALIZES a long, thorough passage — and the
    long thorough passage is exactly the one that governs a claim.  Measured
    on the real record against a real resume bullet: the endnote that actually
    covers the claim scored 6 while unrelated career prose scored 28-30,
    matching on 'communication' and 'gate'.  A floor or a weight tweak would
    not have fixed a ranking that was upside down.

    So the score is IDF-WEIGHTED COVERAGE: of everything that makes this line
    distinctive, how much does this passage account for?  Rare tokens ('vira',
    'retrieval', 'cited') carry the weight, generic career language carries
    almost none, and a thorough passage is rewarded rather than punished.
    Same rare-token principle as radar's person tokens and the atlas's
    shared_topic edge.

    GATE PASSAGES GET A RESERVED SHARE rather than competing on that axis
    (it was a reserved SLOT COUNT until 2026-08-28; the reservation is the
    same, what it is measured in is not — see GATE_SHARE). The endnotes
    decide what the owner may actually SAY, so a strong body match with no
    gate wording alongside it is precisely the shape this feature exists to
    prevent — and measured, the governing endnote sat at rank 26 while its
    narrative section led. Ranking alone would have hidden it.
