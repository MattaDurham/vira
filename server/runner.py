"""Detached durable job runner — a live agent session that outlives Vira.

Spawned by the session registry as its own process group
(.venv python -m server.runner data/jobs/<id>), so a Vira restart —
launchctl kickstart, crash, update-and-restart — no longer kills running
jobs. The runner owns the provider session end to end: it streams
the transcript to output.log, mirrors status / pending permission cards /
heartbeat into state.json, and tails control.jsonl for the owner's
steering, permission decisions, interrupts, and closes (appended by
whichever server process is up — including one booted AFTER this runner
started; the supervisor re-attaches through these same files).

Everything the in-process session had still applies here: the provider's
agent harness with the Vira preamble, the session-scoped "vira" native
tools (imported from viratools — they read Vira's data plane
directly from disk/Keychain, so they keep working even while the server
itself is down), the permission gate with timeout default-deny, plan
publishing, and closing out the launching idea. The runner finalizes its
own joblog record; the stores are cross-process safe (filelock).
