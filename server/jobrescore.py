"""Rescoring — a role's judgment, re-read against today's canon.

WHAT THIS CLOSES. `jobscores.py` (2026-08-12) landed the store and the
reporting: one score per role, provenance stamped by the server, staleness
derived from the canon's own mtime. It answered the owner's question —
1,238 of 1,254 scores predate the Aug 12 canon — and could do nothing
about it. Auto-scoring only ever touches roles with NO score, so a
`why_fit` written in July against a MASTER_HISTORY that has since moved
stayed on screen forever, correct-looking and out of date.

Two depths, the `profilerefresh.py` shape (this module is deliberately its
sibling — read that one first):

  current — ONE `suggest.complete` over the stored posting, the prior
      score, and the passages of the owner's record that actually govern
      a fit judgment for THIS role. Seconds, no session.
  refetch — the posting is refetched first (`jobdesc.describe(refresh=
      True)`), then the same pass. A posting's own text can have changed
      since the sweep stored it, and a rescore against a stale copy would
      re-judge a job that no longer exists in that form.

Plus the QUEUE and the batch prompt behind the scheduled drain: which
roles are stale enough to be worth a session, in the order worth spending
on. `jobboards.maybe_auto_score` is the scheduler — every guard it
already carries (one dispatch in flight, the AI-ready probe, the
20-minute floor) applies unchanged, so this adds a phase rather than a
second scheduler.

THE CANON CANNOT BE INLINED. `MASTER_HISTORY.md` is ~200KB and
`suggest.complete` is a one-shot with no tools, so unlike `score_prompt`
— which tells an AGENT SESSION to go read the file — the one-pass has to
bring the record to the model. It does that through `resumeview._corpus`
/ `_anchors_for`: IDF-weighted coverage retrieval over the record's own
passages, cached on the record's mtime, with the approved-wording
endnotes given a reserved share. Never inline a head excerpt instead —
the head of a career record is an arbitrary slice and usually the wrong
one. How much of it fits is asked of the backend (`budget` below); how
much of it is RELEVANT is `resumeview`'s floors, and the two are
different questions.

WHAT THE SERVER STILL OWNS. Every write goes through
`jobscores.write`, which validates the entry, stamps `scored_at` and
`canon`, and keeps the previous score one deep under `prev`. A rescore is
the exact case that trap was built for: a model that could claim its own
provenance could claim to be newer than it is, and the whole staleness
report reads off those two fields.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the queue

# A rescore carries the prior judgment INTO the session as well as the
# posting, so each role costs more of a session's context than a first
# score does; the batch is smaller than score_prompt's 40 for that reason
# alone. The scheduler runs one session at a time either way.
#
# NOT a context budget, and `modelbudget` is deliberately not asked. What
# bounds a batch is what a SESSION can carry through a whole turn — it
# re-reads the canon and re-reads every posting with its own tools — and
# that is tool-loop consumption, which no prompt-sizing seam can measure.
# The prompt block below is a few kilobytes per role; the reading is the
# cost. Raising this because a window got bigger would spend more of the
# owner's plan per tick on a guess about the wrong quantity.
BATCH = 25

# The batch is read by an agent SESSION whose cwd is the self-record, so it
# can open the score file itself: this excerpt is a POINTER, not the
# material, which is why it is not budgeted the way `prompt()`'s blocks
# are. `modelbudget.has_tools()` names the same distinction — a one-shot
# has to be handed everything, a session only has to be told where to
# look, and spending its working context on prose it can fetch is what
# leaves too little for the postings and the canon it must actually read.
