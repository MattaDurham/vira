"""The source registry: every data source Vira can read, as a table.

models.PROVIDERS answers "what AI backends does this machine have?"; this
module answers the same question for data. Each source — the AddressBook
stores, chat.db, the Calendar store, a Google Contacts export, a mail
account — is a row: what kind of data it yields, which platforms it exists
on at all, and how to probe it. Setup renders the rows it gets, so the
platform fork (Apple cards on a Mac, the cross-platform siblings elsewhere)
is a filter over data, not branching in the wizard.

Three separate facts per source, probed independently (the PROVIDERS
lesson: installed, signed in, and capable are different things):

  - supported — the source can exist on this OS at all (platforms row)
  - present   — it actually exists on this machine (stores found, file on
                disk; always true for pure import paths like a CSV upload)
  - configured — Vira is really wired to it (people imported from it, the
                 store readable past Full Disk Access, an account added)

Everything is derived from the world at probe time and nothing is stored —
the onboard.steps() rule, which is what keeps Setup's re-entry free. All
probes are deterministic, cheap (a glob, a stat, a COUNT on an indexed
sqlite), and never raise: a probe that crashes the caller is worse than one
that says "unknown". Adding a source (a P2 Google Calendar sync, a Windows
messages bridge) is a new row here plus its card in the Setup UI — not new
wizard branching.
