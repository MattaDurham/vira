"""Read a hand-written resume or cover letter and mark it up against a role.

The owner writes drafts by hand in Word. Everything needed to check one
already exists and had no way to reach a file he wrote himself: the claim
gate in MASTER_HISTORY's endnotes, VOICE.md's standing bans, this role's job
description, and what the employer says it hires for. This module is the
join.

WHAT COMES BACK IS A DOCX HE OPENS IN WORD, and one rule governs it:

    BLACK IS HIS. COLOURED IS VIRA'S.

Not one character of the draft is altered, reordered or dropped - his text
renders verbatim in black, and every suggestion is a separate coloured line
beneath the line it is about. That is what makes a bad suggestion free: he
reads past it. `test_the_owners_text_is_reproduced_verbatim` pins it.

TWO COLOURS, because two different things are being said:

  BLUE  - a proposed REWRITE or a keyword to work in. Something to adopt.
  CLAY  - a FLAG. Something to check, with no rewrite offered.

THE DISTINCTION IS LOAD-BEARING AND IT IS WHY THE OWNER'S "rewrites in
colour" answer is implemented as two shapes rather than one. A voice ban or
a keyword gap has an honest better wording, so it gets one. A claim with no
endnote anchor does NOT: the fix is adjudication against the record, and
inventing a rewrite there would be inventing evidence - the exact failure
the claim gate exists to prevent. So a gate finding is stated as a flag and
never dressed as a suggestion.

NO python-docx. `applicationmap._docx_markdown` reads docx with stdlib XML
and says why in its own docstring - making the writer pull a dependency the
reader deliberately avoids would be the module arguing with itself. A docx
is a zip of four XML parts and a coloured run is three attributes.

Read-only against everything but its own output: the draft is never written
back, the package is never touched, and the marked copy lands beside the
role as a new file.

structurally cannot carry, and shows that this company is where that way of
working is the point. The two halves are welded. A letter that walks the
posting's requirement list in prose has done the resume's job twice and the
letter's job not at all. If a paragraph is in the letter because the posting
asked for it, say so - that is the most valuable finding you can return.

A RESUME is judged differently: verb-led bullets, dense specifics, no
adjective inflation, the career's shape preserved, claims carrying concepts
and what he built rather than proof chains.

RULES ON YOUR OWN OUTPUT, and they are enforced after you answer:
- A rewrite may ONLY restate what his line already says. You may not add a

    answering the call reports a 1,000,000-token window and real postings
    run to 24,000 characters. So a quarter of the thing the draft is being
    judged against was being cut off, silently, and a judgment made from
    the surviving quarter reads exactly like one made from the whole.

    prompt with the employer's hiring signals and the draft itself.

    THE DRAFT IS NOT BUDGETED, deliberately: the model answers with LINE
    INDEXES into it, so dropping lines to fit would produce findings that
    address a document the owner never sent. Its bound is MAX_LINES, which
    is a fact about what a hand-written draft is, not about a window.
