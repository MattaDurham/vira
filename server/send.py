"""Send messages from the app via Messages.app (AppleScript). Deterministic —
no AI involved; the text is whatever the user approved in the UI.

iMessage vs SMS/text — the silent-failure this module fixes: sending to an
Android (or otherwise iMessage-less) recipient over the iMessage service
"succeeds" from AppleScript's point of view, then the balloon quietly turns
red "Not Delivered" and nothing the app can see ever reports it. Two guards:

  - proactive: a contact the owner marked SMS, or one chat.db shows has
    only ever been reachable over SMS, is sent on the SMS service from the
    start (best case — no failed attempt at all);
  - reactive: an iMessage send is verified against chat.db for a few
    seconds; if the row errors, Vira re-sends it as a text AND remembers
    (sendpref, source="inferred") so the next send is proactive.

Sending SMS needs Text Message Forwarding to the paired iPhone (Messages
must own an SMS-service account). When it doesn't, we say so plainly rather
than failing quietly — the whole point here is to never fail silently.
