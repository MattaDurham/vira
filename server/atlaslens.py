"""Lenses — four ways to band the same web.

The graph is ONE set of people and ties. How it is COLOURED is a question
the owner asks of it, not a property of the data: who are my circles, who
works together, who lives where. So banding is a LENS laid over the graph
rather than a second graph, and every lens reads the materialized
`atlas-graph.json` that is already on disk:

  groups     the atlas's identity clusters — families, shared employers,
             the pinned anchor org, plus the owner's own custom groups.
             This is the legend the module has always had, minus the
             derived social mesh below.
  circles    the residual social clusters label propagation found. They
             used to sit in the same chip list as the families and drown
             them; they are their own question.
  companies  everyone sharing an employer, whether or not they clustered.
             An org CLUSTER only forms among people whose ties cleared the
             edge threshold, so this band is always the wider set — which
             is what "show me the connections between companies" wants.
  locations  city (and state) off the local AddressBook cards.

Nothing here is stored and nothing is inferred by a model: a lens is a
regroup of nodes the graph already carries, so it costs one pass over the
node list and can never drift from the graph it describes. Coverage is
REPORTED per lens (`placed` / `total`) because two of these read fields
most contacts leave empty, and a lens that silently bands a third of the
web would read as "these are all the companies".
