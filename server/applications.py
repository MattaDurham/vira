"""Applications module — the job-application catalog.

A merged, deduplicated role catalog the owner can star, comment on, track
status against, and — the point — write an application for, which
dispatches the `application-package` skill as a live agent session that
builds the full package (tailored CV, cover letter, form answers,
interview prep).  Whether a role HAS a package is read off disk rather
than off that dispatch (`applicationmap.written_for`), so the catalog
reports what exists rather than what was asked for.

Roles arrive from two kinds of source: the live board poller
(server/jobboards.py, generic — a registry of company boards per ATS) and
any static corpora the owner points `applications_sources` at. Setup
(server/frontdoor.py) wires the first for a new install; the second is
how an existing analysis pipeline plugs in.

Design:
- **Roles are read, never owned.** The teardown data.js files stay the source
  of truth for what roles exist and how they score; this module re-parses them
  (mtime-cached) so a re-run of a teardown pipeline shows up on next load.
- **Owner state is keyed by stable uid** (board job id extracted from the
  posting URL), in data/applications.json — stars/comments/status survive
  re-ingests and teardown re-runs.
- **Dedupe prefers the richer record**: a role present in both a company
  teardown (fit-scored) and the frontier full-board corpus keeps the teardown
  record; frontier-only roles carry fit=None and sort below scored ones.
- **Connections**: the LinkedIn export's Connections.csv gives a per-company
  "who could refer me" count surfaced in the UI; the deep referral work
  happens in the skill at package time.
