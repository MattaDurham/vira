"""The capability probe: what AI backends does THIS Mac actually have?

Setup's first step asks the owner to connect a model, and the honest way to
ask is to look rather than assume. Two things make assumption fail:

  1. **A binary on disk is not a binary on PATH.** The Codex CLI ships
     inside ChatGPT.app (`/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/
     codex`) and is not linked anywhere `which` would find it. A PATH check
     alone reports "OpenAI not installed" to someone who is signed in and
     has the app open.
  2. **Installed is not signed in, and signed in is not capable.** A
     provider can be present but logged out, or authenticated by
     subscription rather than key, and the two auth modes do different
     things for cost.

So each provider is a row in PROVIDERS: where its binary hides, how to ask
it about auth without spending a token, and what Vira can actually do with
it. Adding xAI or a local runtime is a data edit, not new branching.

Everything here is deterministic and free — the same contract as
aihealth.probe(). No model call, no token spend, and nothing raises: a
probe that crashes the caller is worse than one that says "unknown".

MODEL SOURCES — the one rule (2026-07-28)
-----------------------------------------
**Vira offers a model name only if it can verify that name right now.**
Exactly three sources can be verified, and every picker in the app is fed
from them:

  1. **An ALIAS the provider's own CLI resolves** (`opus`, `sonnet`,
     `haiku`, `fable`). An alias names a TIER, never a generation, so it
     is right the week Opus 5 ships and no one has to edit anything.
  2. **The LIVE `/v1/models` list**, when a key is on file. The provider
     is the authority on its own catalog.
  3. **The installed provider CLI's OWN CATALOG OR CONFIG** on this machine.
     Codex exposes its bundled catalog through ``debug models --bundled``;
     config.toml remains the compatibility fallback for older binaries.
     Both are probes like find_binary, not product pins.

Anything else is a guess with a shelf life, and a guess renders exactly
like a fact. That is how "Opus 4.8" and "GPT-5.6 Sol" stayed on screen
long after both were stale: they lived in curated fallback lists that
only an admin edit and a push could ever refresh. Those lists are gone.
Where nothing is verifiable the picker says so and offers the custom-id
hatch — an honest empty beats a confident wrong name.

So: do NOT reintroduce a hardcoded model id here, in suggest.DEFAULTS, in
config.example.json, or as an <option> in index.html. If a picker looks
empty, the fix is a key or an alias, never a literal.
