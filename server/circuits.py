"""Circuits — multi-model agent pipelines as executable DAGs.

The breadboard lab's design-to-orchestration compiler, running on Vira's
own session engine. A circuit is a set of STAGES; each stage is one agent
session (model + mode + prompt template); `needs` edges are the wires. A
stage with no needs is an entry point; `{{input}}` substitutes the run's
input and `{{stage.<id>.output}}` threads an upstream stage's final text
into a downstream prompt — the out->in handoff, verbatim from the
breadboard export semantics.

This is how "Fable writes the plan, Sonnet executes it" happens: stage
`plan` runs read-only on `fable`, stage `build` (needs: plan) runs
bypassPermissions on sonnet with the plan wired into its prompt, and stage
`judge` (mode: judge) spawns a FRESH session that grades the build — with
an optional GRADE GATE: verdict below min_grade relaunches the target
stage with the judge's findings appended, up to max_retries times (the
grader-gated loop).

Execution facts:
- Every stage run is a normal detached durable job (session registry) —
  it gets a terminal window, a ledger row, restart survival.
- All run state lives in data/circuit-runs.json (fcntl-locked writes);
  the driver thread is stateless between ticks, so a server restart
  resumes every running circuit exactly where it was.
- The live-session cap applies naturally: a stage that can't launch yet
  (cap reached) just stays ready and is retried next tick.

Stores:
  data/circuits.json      — definitions (seeded with builtin templates)
  data/circuit-runs.json  — runs; stages_def frozen per run at start
