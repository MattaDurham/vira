    A first run happens once per install, which makes the one screen a
    stranger sees hardest to look at twice — reviewing it meant going back to
    a shell and re-running a script. This is that, as a button on the badge.

    Two things a stranger's first boot has that a re-walk did not: the CURRENT
    code, and no leftovers. Both are handled here, in that order, because they
    fail differently.

    The PULL happens in-process, so a refusal is reported in the browser —
    `update.pull()` already refuses a dirty tree and raises DepsError when the
    code moved but its dependencies did not. That one is fatal: restarting
    onto new code with old deps is exactly what update.apply() refuses to do,
    so the reset stops with the checkout updated and the server untouched. An
    ordinary refusal (no network, no remote) is reported as a note and the
    reset carries on — a walk-through blocked by an offline laptop would be a
    worse failure than a slightly stale one.

    The WIPE is queued for the relaunch loop rather than done here. data/ holds
    open sqlite handles belonging to this process; deleting it underneath them
    and then serving from the wreckage is not a virgin install, it is a broken
    one. So the loop does it in the gap between two runs (see the SUPERVISOR
    note in scripts/sandbox.sh), and this endpoint exits into it.

    Without a loop there is nothing to exit into, so the reset degrades to the
    old shallow behaviour — the ui-state keys — and SAYS SO rather than
    implying it did more.

    Refused anywhere but a sandbox. The live instance and a branch test
    instance both carry real arrangements and a real connected account, and

# ---------- TC-IL morning picker (subs-visuals: status / files / apply) ----

# serve time, and dispatches the headless /subs-visuals-apply job on submit.

# save endpoint (designstudio.router) rewrites theme tokens, commits, and
# pushes in that repo. Dormant when the repo directory is missing.

# the top of the Design Studio module.

# ---------- Image Atlas (the vault's images as a 3D galaxy) ----------------
