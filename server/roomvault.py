"""Reading-room items as vault notes — the ingest behind "everything in
the room is in the vault".

A room is a researched catalog of external material (readingroom.py). It
lives in Vira's own store, which makes it renderable and countable but
leaves it INVISIBLE to everything the vault is for: qocha retrieval, the
Obsidian graph, a `[[wikilink]]` from any other note. This module closes
that — it projects a room into the vault so its contents are searchable
and interconnected like any other note.

THE VAULT IS A PROJECTION TARGET, NEVER A SECOND SOURCE OF TRUTH. The
room store is canonical; every note here is derived from it and carries
`room_item_id`, so a re-run finds its own output and UPDATES it rather
than minting a duplicate. That id is the room's own stable id (a hash of
the URL), so a retitled item keeps its note and an item that survives a
full repass keeps its place in the graph. Nothing here WRITES back into
the room — but see "which note belongs to this item" at the foot: the
Reader has to be able to ASK where an item's note ended up, and that
lookup reuses the same `room_item_id` key, derived live rather than
stored.

THE POINTER-NOTE ERA ENDED 2026-08-05 (owner's ruling: pointer pages
"don't help me at all" — every item's material is fully ingested
instead; see server/fullingest.py). This module no longer MINTS
`wiki/rooms/<item>.md` pointer notes. What each item gets now is a REAL
source-summary: fullingest stages the material into raw/reading-room/,
the vault's own nightly ingest (or a bulk fleet) synthesizes the
summary carrying `room_item_id`, and fullingest.reconcile writes the
item's `vault` field and retires the item's legacy pointer note into
pending-user-deletion/. Until an item's summary lands, its legacy
pointer (if one exists from the pointer era) keeps serving; a brand-new
item simply has no note yet and the hub says so by linking nothing.

SO THE OUTPUT IS ONE SHAPE now, plus a legacy one it still reads:

  wiki/<room>-reading-room.md   type: reference — the catalog page. Every
                                item, annotated, linking each item's
                                summary (or its not-yet-retired pointer).

  wiki/rooms/<item>.md          LEGACY pointer notes, read-only here:
                                still indexed (notes_by_item) so the
                                Reader resolves them until reconcile
                                retires each one behind its summary.

Writes use the selected connected vault and its destination policies.

# The projection above is one-directional by design, which left the Reader
# unable to answer a question its own cards were asking: is this in the
# vault? An item's `vault` field is the OWNER'S SUMMARY and nothing else —
# ingest() mints a pointer note precisely when that field is EMPTY — so
# reading it as "does a note exist" reports the opposite of the truth for
# every item this module has ever catalogued. On 2026-07-30 that was 263 of
# 348 cards saying "No vault note yet" over a note sitting in the vault.
#
# THE POINTER PATH IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. It is a fact about what is on
# disk right now, and a copy of it in the room store is a copy that goes
# stale the moment a note is renamed, moved or deleted — which is the exact
# failure being fixed here, so storing it would only move the staleness. The
# join is EXACT, not a guess: ingest() writes `room_item_id` into every
# note's frontmatter for its own idempotency, and that is the key read back.
# So there is no refresh step to run and none to forget.
#
# The owner overlay is the deliberate exception. A note that ingest() did
# not write carries no `room_item_id`, so nothing can derive the link — the
# owner attaching one by hand is genuinely new information. It lives in its
# own store and is applied at read time (the contactcard.py pattern), so it
# survives every room rebuild instead of being overwritten by the next one.
