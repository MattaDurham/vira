"""Per-role job scores — one score per role, written by Vira.

WHAT THIS REPLACES. A role's judgment (fit, why_fit, tier, lane, verdict)
used to be APPENDED into whichever batch file the agent session that scored
it happened to name that day. No code ever wrote one: `jobboards.score_prompt`
composed an English instruction saying "append a score entry to
2026-08-12-raw-scores.json" and a session wrote the JSON by hand. So the
filename was a suggestion, and 111 files accumulated under 1,254 entries —
`v2`, `d6`, forty `swarm-<ts>-batch-NNN`, eleven dates, and fifty more
carrying invented `b`/`c`/`d` suffixes minted by sessions that found the
day's file already there.

Reading them merged every file in SORTED FILENAME ORDER, later file wins.
That is the trap this module exists to close: digits sort before letters, so
a file named `<today>-raw-scores.json` — exactly what score_prompt generates
— loses every uid collision against `swarm-*` and `v2-*`. It has never bitten
(measured 2026-08-12: zero uids appear in more than one file, because the
pipeline only ever scored roles that had NO score). It would bite the moment
anything RE-scores a role: the new entry would land on disk, look correct,
and be silently overridden by the July pass it was meant to replace.

THE FIX IS A STORE, NOT A SORT RULE. One file per role at
`<universe>/scores/<uid>.json`, so there is no merge and nothing for
precedence to get wrong; a rescore overwrites one file. Legacy batch files
stay on disk and are still read for any uid with no per-role file, so the
migration is additive and reversible.

THE SERVER STAMPS PROVENANCE, NEVER THE MODEL. `scored_at` and `canon` are
written here, because a rescore that could claim to be newer than it is
would defeat the staleness reporting those fields exist to feed. The write
goes through `write()` behind `validate()` — the same proposes/validates/
applies discipline as `update_module_map`, `create_reading_room` and
`configure_applications`.

STALENESS IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. `canon_at()` is the newest mtime across
the owner's MASTER_HISTORY and their standing adjudication; a score written
before that moment is stale by definition. Move the canon and every earlier
score reads stale on the next request, with no sweep to run and no flag to
maintain.

Entry shape (everything beyond the named fields is preserved verbatim —
the corpus carries `served`, `_fulluid`, `_title`, `verify_note` and more,
and a store that dropped them would lose data on migration):
