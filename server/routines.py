"""Routines — Vira's standing agent loops.

The "different types of loops" engine: a routine is a recurring agent
dispatch — a prompt (or a whole circuit) on a cadence. Kinds:

  muse    — the idea generator. Composed server-side at dispatch: reads
            the current backlog + radar, searches the vault, and PROPOSES
            new ideas via the propose_idea native tool. Proposals land in
            the Ideas queue as status "proposed" — nothing runs without
            the owner's approval. The permissioned-autonomy loop.
  watch   — a watcher: run a prompt, notify when something needs eyes.
  digest  — a synthesizer: periodic summary/analysis runs.
  circuit — dispatch a whole circuits.py pipeline on a cadence.
  custom  — any prompt, any cadence.

Cadence: every_hours (float) OR daily_at "HH:MM" (local). The Scheduler
thread (60s tick) dispatches due routines as normal durable jobs / circuit
runs — terminals, ledger rows, restart survival all apply — records
last_run/last_job/last_status, skips while the previous run is still
live, and iMessages the owner on completion when notify is set.

Store: data/routines.json (atomic writes; server-only writer).
