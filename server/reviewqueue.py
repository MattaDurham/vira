"""Needs review — one queue for every decision that is waiting on the owner.

THE FAILURE THIS ENDS. The corrections ledger's proposal pipeline ran
nightly from 2026-07-25 and staged 113 proposals; NONE were ever approved,
because nothing ever put them in front of the owner. lessons.py is explicit
that "promotion is an explicit act" — it just never said where that act
happens. A pending decision nobody can see is not pending, it is rotting.
The same shape repeats across the machine: self-record inbox stubs whose
documented steady state is empty, open adjudication flags in the canon, and
Vira's own `proposed` ideas.

So this is an AGGREGATOR, not a lessons panel. Each contributing store is a
SOURCE registered here with one reader and (optionally) one actor; the queue
knows nothing about any store's file format beyond what its reader returns.
Adding a source is adding a `register(Source(...))` call. Seven today:
lesson proposals, the self-record inbox, open adjudication flags, proposed
ideas, un-staged journal instructions, contact-worthy unknown senders, and
a pending Morning Picker batch.

FOUR RULES THIS MODULE IS BENT AROUND:

1. **A source never breaks the queue.** Every reader runs inside
   `_safe_read`: a raised exception becomes an entry in `errors` and an
   empty list, exactly the way brief.py degrades a section rather than
   502-ing the whole brief. A missing file is not even an error — it is a
   store that has nothing to say today.

2. **VIRA NEVER WRITES THE LEDGER, AND NEVER REPAIRS ITS INPUTS.** Approving
   a lesson shells out to `lessons.py` (list-form argv, never a shell); that
   script owns LESSONS.md, its dedupe, its cap, and the decided-jsonl side
   store. The proposals file belongs to daily-provenance.py and is never
   rewritten from here — including to fix the duplicate ids described in
   `_lessons_act`, which are being fixed at the generator instead.

3. **Reading is not deciding.** Sources whose items are prose in the
   owner's own canon (the self-record inbox, the open adjudication flags)
   are surfaced READ-ONLY: `actions: []`. Absorbing an inbox note into
   canon is an adjudication act that happens in the record with the whole
   document in view, not a button in a brief. Vira's job here is to make
   the item visible, which is the entire thing that was missing.

4. **Every path is configuration.** Nothing here hardcodes a home
   directory; the roots come from settings overrides (the
   `applications.connections_csv` idiom) and otherwise derive from
   `Path.home()`. Tests repoint every root at one tmp fixture, and
   `roots()` declares the whole set in one place so a root added later
   cannot silently read the real machine (the readinglist lesson).
