"""Job boards — the live feed behind the Applications module.

The D6-a universe expansion (owner ballot 2026-07-15, built 2026-07-17):
where `applications.py` reads static teardown corpora, this module OWNS the
board layer — a registry of company job boards, deterministic fetchers per
ATS, a snapshot + diff state so every poll knows what is NEW and what
CLOSED, an iMessage ping when a new eligible role appears, and a poller
that runs the whole loop on a cadence. Everything expensive (deep-read
scoring) stays agent work dispatched on demand; everything here is plain
HTTP + JSON and safe to run every few minutes.

Design:
- **The registry is data, not code** (`boards.json` in the boards dir —
  default `<universe>/boards/` next to the candidate universe in the
  owner's self-record). Adding a company is one registry entry; the next
  poll sweeps it. Supported `ats` kinds: greenhouse, ashby, lever,
  microsoft (Eightfold pcsx), google (embedded-JSON careers pages), and
  `manual` for boards that cannot be fetched headlessly (surfaced in the
  UI as such, never silently dropped).
- **Snapshot + state live next to the registry** (`snapshot.json`,
  `state.json`) — the self-record is the source of truth for the search,
  so the fetched universe lives there too, where scoring sessions read
  and extend it. Roles that disappear from a board are marked `closed`,
  never deleted.
- **Eligibility gates the PING, not the data.** Every fetched role lands
  in the snapshot. A role is `eligible` when its location passes the
  owner's NYC-or-remote rule AND it survives the standing owner
  adjudication (comp `ote` / selling-marketing titles cut — reused from
  `applications._load_adjudication`; never cut by the board's function
  label). Only new eligible roles ping the phone; the rest are visible
  in the module's All-boards view.
- **Notifications ride notify.agent_ping** (the proven iMessage path) —
  one batched message per poll cycle, deduped per-uid in state so a
  restart never re-pings.

    what this board has served before, never proof the posting is gone.

    Two facts about the API decide the shape. (a) The listing endpoint is
    cheap but collapses a multi-site posting's location to "5 Locations",
    which no location rule can read — and judging that ineligible would
    silently hide exactly the roles posted in the most places, New York
    among them. (b) It carries no description and no real date: `postedOn`
    is prose ("Posted 24 Days Ago"). Real location, real `startDate` and
    the description all live on the per-role detail endpoint.

    So the listing walk PREFILTERS on the location text it can actually
    read, keeps every ambiguous one, and pays for detail only on the
    survivors — and REPORTS what a cap dropped rather than handing back a
    short list that looks complete.

    A board wants a `query` (the cxs `searchText`): an unnarrowed walk of
