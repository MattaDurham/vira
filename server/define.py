"""On-demand term definitions — a ladder that erases its own rungs.

Right-click any selected text in Vira and a definition card opens.  The card
is composed by the cheapest rung that can answer:

    rung 0  glossary   an existing term note in the vault      ~1ms, no model
    rung 1  atlas      the curated AI-terminology atlas        ~1ms, no model
    rung 2  vault      a note whose title IS the term          ~5ms, no model
    rung 3  model      one suggest.complete over gathered context   2-4s
    rung 4  sourced    a live session that browses and cites   on demand only

THE POINT OF THE WHOLE MODULE is that rung 3 and rung 4 write their result
back into the vault as an ordinary `type: concept` page.  So the SECOND
lookup of a term answers from rung 0, the wiki gains a page, Find's index
picks it up within a scan, and the term joins the graph through `## Related`
wikilinks in both directions.  A climb is paid once.

Why the note is the source of truth and `data/glossary.json` is only an
index: the note is the artifact the owner actually wants and can edit in
Obsidian, and a stored copy of its prose would go stale the moment he did.
The index carries provenance and a pointer, and the card is re-read from the
note — the readinglist soft-pointer rule.

What rung 3 may and may not produce is the load-bearing distinction.  A model
reliably knows what a term MEANS, what it is distinct from, and roughly where
it came from; that is stable knowledge and it is what a dictionary is.  It
does not reliably know a URL, a date, or who said it first.  So rung 3 emits
prose and NO links, and `_validate` strips any it invents.  Only rung 4,
which actually browses, may write the `links` list.

2. Research the term on the web. Find the ACTUAL origin (the paper, post, \
talk, or spec that introduced it or first used it in its current sense) and \
one or two current authoritative uses.
3. Correct any claim in the note that your research contradicts — especially \
in "Etymology and lineage", which was written from memory and is the field \
most likely to be wrong.
4. Rewrite the note, keeping its existing structure exactly: the same \
frontmatter fields, the same `## ` section headings in the same order. \
Set `vira_rung: sourced` and `vira_sourced: true`.
5. Add a `## Read further` section (or replace the existing one) as a \
markdown list of `- [label](url)` links. EVERY url must be one you actually \
fetched and confirmed resolves. Omit a link you could not verify rather than \
guessing; a dead citation is the whole reason this step exists.
6. Leave the `## Related` section's wikilinks alone.

Do not create other notes. Do not restart the Vira server. Finish with a \
two-line report: what you corrected, and how many links you verified."""
