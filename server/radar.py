"""Radar — who deserves attention, and who should meet whom.

Two engines, both explainable:

priority_people() — a deterministic ranking of who the owner should talk
to next, scored from live signals (each row carries its reasons): owed
replies (chat.db), going-quiet decay on active-tier contacts, stale open
loops weighted toward what the OWNER owes, birthdays inside a week,
available conversation hooks (something to actually say), and live
conversation MARKERS — a thing that just landed and this one person
cares about it. Reuses the Daily Brief's loaders; same freshness, same
cost profile (~100ms), and markers come off the cached store rather than
the wire.

groupings — the connector engine, sized by audience rather than fixed at
pairs. Profile text (summary, hooks, facts, company/title) is tokenized
per person and INVERTED: a rare token maps straight to everyone carrying
it, so a topic four people share surfaces as one grouping instead of six
disconnected pairs. A pair is just the degenerate case.

Two triggers feed the same candidate shape:

  overlap — the standing signal: rare-but-shared profile tokens across
            the ~120 most active contacts, weighted by token rarity.
  event   — what just happened, read locally: links the owner's contacts
            actually shared in chat.db over the last few weeks, matched
            against the same fingerprints. An item whose audience is
            exactly one person is not a grouping at all — it becomes a
            marker on that person's row.

Candidates are then annotated deterministically — the Contact Atlas says
whether the members already know each other, chat.db says whether a
group thread already covers them — which is what picks the move (post to
the thread you have, start a group chat, make an introduction). ONE AI
pass then curates the survivors into named topics with an opener.

Cached in data/radar-groupings.json (the grouping-scout routine refreshes
weekly; a button refreshes on demand); dismissals persist, and a legacy
data/radar-intros.json seeds the store once so old dismissals carry over.

# ---------- the AI curation pass ----------

CURATE_PROMPT = """You are {owner}'s chief of staff, deciding which of \
{owner}'s contacts are worth putting in a room together right now.

Below are candidate GROUPINGS — two to five people who share real ground, \
each with the shared topics, a short dossier per person, and the trigger \
that surfaced them. Some were surfaced by a live item someone actually \
shared; those are the strongest, because there is a reason to reach out \
TODAY. Each candidate also says whether the members already know each \
other and whether a group thread with them already exists.

Pick only the groupings that are genuinely worth acting on — where every \
member plausibly gains something concrete. Drop a member who does not fit \
(keep at least two). Skip overlap that is coincidental wording, family \
members of each other, and rooms nobody would want.

Prefer the ROOM over the pair. When a candidate of three or more holds up \
— the ground is real for every one of them — pick it rather than the \
two-person versions of the same thing; a room of people who all care is \
worth more to {owner} than the same connection made twice. Shrink a room \
only when a member does not actually belong in it.

Set "move" to one of:
  post_to_group — a group thread with these people already exists; bring \
it up there
  group_chat    — worth starting a new group chat
  introduction  — exactly two people who should meet

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{"groupings": [{{"members": ["pid", "pid", ...],
  "topic": "<the shared ground, 2-5 words, in plain language>",
  "move": "post_to_group|group_chat|introduction",
  "why": "<one or two sentences: the concrete mutual value, and why now>",
  "opener": "<a short message {owner} could send to open it — a \
double-opt-in ask for an introduction, or the actual first line for a \
group>"}}]}}
