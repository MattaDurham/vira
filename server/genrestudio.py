"""Genre Studio — compose a new visual genre out of pieces of reference images.

THE REBUILD (owner, 2026-07-27): every trace of the skin is gone from this
surface. The previous build was a skin wizard wearing image clothes — twelve of
its twenty rows (corners, fills, depth, ink density, chrome case, glass) existed
because a stylesheet needs them, not because an image has an opinion about them,
and each row carried a `transfers` flag whose only job was to say whether a SKIN
consumed it. The result told you, in words, that the interesting material was
the leftovers. So: the rows are now the vocabulary of an image prompt, the
deliverable is a genre, and applying a genre to a skin is somebody else's
problem, downstream, reading the manifest this module writes.

WHAT A GENRE IS HERE: a recipe. Each reference is decomposed into the FRAGMENTS
of the prompt that would produce it — its subject, its vantage, how it is made,
its palette, its light, its rules — and the genre is whichever fragments you
keep, from whichever images. The far column composes them back into one prompt
and renders it, and that take can be promoted to a reference and decomposed in
turn. That loop is the instrument.

    references --> fragments --> what you keep --> recipe --> a new image
        ^                                                        |
        +---------------- promote a take <-----------------------+

FOUR RULES THIS BUILD HOLDS, each one a correction earned:

1. ROWS ARE A SPINE PLUS WHATEVER THE IMAGES NAME. `ROWS` is the canonical set
   a prompt is made of, always asked for so the columns line up; the vision pass
   may also name rows of its own (`_clean_rows` admits them as OPEN rows) so an
   image whose whole character is one unusual thing has somewhere to put it.

2. FRAGMENTS ARE PRE-CHECKED, AND CHECKED IS ALL THERE IS. Nothing resolves,
   votes, or proposes behind your back: the combined column is exactly the set
   of checked fragments, and `sel` stores them explicitly rather than letting
   absence mean anything. The previous build's engine — colour tolerance,
   majority/heaviest/first conflict resolution, inclusion thresholds,
   evidence-weighted coherence, sub-genre clustering — is DELETED. It existed to
   settle disagreements between automatic readings, and once every value is
   picked by hand there is nothing to settle.

3. COMPLETENESS IS REPORTED, AGREEMENT IS NOT. A row says how many references
   offered it something; an image says how much of the spine it answered. That
   is a real fact about coverage. A score claiming the set is "one voice" was
   an opinion dressed as a measurement, and it is gone with the rest.

4. NO SKIN VOCABULARY, ANYWHERE. Not a row, not a flag, not a preview, not an
   install button. `export_manifest` writes a genre.json whose palette and
   covenants sit where the lab genre system already looks for them; deriving
   interface roles from that is a consumer's job, and this module deliberately
   does not do it — inventing role names here is the exact thinking being
   removed.

Rung 1 (PIL, deterministic, never fails) extracts the palette. Rung 2 (one
optional vision call per image) reconstructs the prompt and splits it. Without a
model the studio is a colour-taking tool and says so plainly — that is a real
narrowing, and the honest report of it is `vision_status()`.

Storage: `data/genres/<id>/patch.json` beside its images. The patch is the saved
instrument; regenerable in shape, canonical in role.
