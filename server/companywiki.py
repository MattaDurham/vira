"""The employer's own page in the vault, resolved and measured for one
application.

A cover letter's whole job is to connect this career to THIS company — what
they do, what they say they are for, and why the owner wants to be there.
Until now the only company context an Apply dispatch carried was Anthropic's:
the skill named `canon/targets/anthropic.md` by hand and `research.py`'s graph
catalog holds exactly one row, so a letter for any of the other ten companies
in the catalog was written against the job description alone.

The material already exists. The vault holds 124 `type: entity` pages, and the
catalog's employers are among them. This module RESOLVES a company name to
that page and MEASURES it.

It never writes. Expanding a thin page is research and prose, done in the
vault under the vault's own conventions — the fullingest split, where staging
is deterministic and synthesis is a model's job. Vira's job here is to name
the path and the gap honestly, so a session cannot mistake "no page" for
"nothing to say".

THE RESOLUTION RUNG IS ALWAYS REPORTED. A page about Microsoft is not a page
about Microsoft AI, and presenting one as the other is the wikilink-resolution
failure in a different costume: a plausible wrong answer is worse than an
honest miss, because the letter it produces reads as tailored while being
about the wrong company.
