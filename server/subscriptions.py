"""Subscriptions: merchant registry + charge ledger + deterministic cadence
engine — what does the owner actually pay for, at what cadence, and what
renews next?

Two stores, split by the code-data seam doctrine:

- data/subscriptions.json — the merchant REGISTRY. Human curation (canonical
  name, aliases, login URL, category, cadence override, lifecycle status).
  Non-regenerable; joins the backup rotation. Atomic tmp+rename writes.
- data/subs-ledger.sqlite — the charge LEDGER. Regenerable cache of Mercury
  charges (server/mercury.py writes it) and receipt evidence (phase 3).

The cadence engine (reconcile) is fully deterministic — no AI, no wall-clock
dependence. All math anchors to the newest ledger charge ("data through"),
never today's date: the stale-window deflation that broke the old page
(estimates sagging ~30% as the data aged) is impossible by construction.

Engine rules, in order:

1. Grouping: charges map to merchants via registry aliases (exact lowercase
   counterparty match). Unknown counterparties auto-create a stub merchant
   flagged needs_review.
2. Classification uses intervals between the FIRST charge of each distinct
   charge-bearing calendar month — NOT successive raw charges, because two
   concurrent subscriptions at one merchant interleave and destroy raw
   intervals (Anthropic: two subs -> gaps of 2-4 days that read as noise).
   Median month-collapsed interval -> band: 25-35d monthly, 75-105 quarterly,
   150-210 semi-annual, 330-400 annual. Single charge-bearing month ->
   one-time. Median in a gap between bands -> unclear.
3. Estimates: monthly -> median_low of per-calendar-month sums over the last
   3 charge-bearing months (recent window = the CURRENT subscription mix;
   median over all history undercounts after a second seat/plan is added,
   and median_low keeps the figure an actually-observed month). Annual /
   semi-annual / quarterly -> last cycle amount x1/x2/x4 for the year, /12
   monthly. One-time -> the charge IS the yearly figure, /12 monthly (the
   owner's rule).
4. Anchoring: "last charge" is by DATE (the old page read array position);
   staleness is displayed, never silently corrected for.
5. Projection: next renewal = last charge + median observed interval (band
   nominal when no interval). A receipt-derived next_billing_date overrides
   the projection when evidence exists (phase 3).
6. Lapse: a recurring merchant with no charge within 1.5x its period of
   data-through -> flag possibly_canceled.
7. Conflicts are surfaced, never silently resolved: observed cadence beats a
   disagreeing registry override for the math but raises cadence_conflict
   (Google One: catalog said annual, card says monthly). A cadence read from
   a single interval raises cadence_uncertain (Archer: two charges 77 days
   apart — quarterly or semi-annual? only the next charge can answer).
8. Evidence-first anomaly handling (the owner's rule, 2026-07-10): a charge
   outside a merchant's established pattern is A NEW CHARGE to verify, never
   a silent repricing of the monthly. Monthly merchants decompose into
   recurring same-amount STREAMS (two concurrent subs = two streams); the
   estimate is the sum of active streams, and off-stream charges (a one-off
   spike, an extra same-month occurrence) go to `evidence_needed` — "locate
   the invoice or receipt that classifies this" (overage? plan change?
   one-off?). Merchants whose amounts vary too much to form streams (usage
   billing, base-plus-overage) estimate by month-sum median and carry an
   amount_variance entry instead. The receipts pass (phase 3) consumes this
   queue; until then it renders as a review prompt — which is also the
   record-keeping nudge: everything here should have an invoice somewhere.
