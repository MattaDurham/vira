"""Tagging documents with the SAME vocabulary the ideas backlog already uses.

The Reader holds 500-odd documents — plans, walkthroughs, retros, dossiers,
briefs — ordered by nothing but date. Ordered by date, a document library is a
pile: the plan that proposed the Reader, the film of the session that built it,
and the retro of the night it shipped sit weeks apart with nothing saying they
are the same story.

They are the same story, and the app already knows the word for it. ideatags
tags every idea on four axes, and `module` is defined as "the part of the
product this touches" — which is exactly "what feature is this, and where does
it go". So this module mints NOTHING. It reads ideatags.AXES for the axes,
ideatags.vocabulary() for the words in use, and ideatags._clean_tags to
validate, so a document and the idea it came from land under the same tag
rather than under `reader` and `reading-room`.

WHY A SEPARATE STORE AND NOT A FEW MORE ROWS IN ideatags: its `_prune` reads
its item list as "everything that exists" and deletes the rest — the documented
2026-07-27 incident where one Similar panel destroyed 134 of 135 entries. Ideas
and documents are two populations; putting them in one sidecar means every
prune has to be right about both forever. Two stores cannot make that mistake.

TWO RUNGS, and rung 1 stands alone:

  1. DETERMINISTIC. A document whose title or slug leaf literally contains a
     module already in use is tagged with it — no model call, no network.
     MEASURED on this corpus: 24 of 519, about 4%. That is a floor, not the
     mechanism, and the number is here because the first draft of this
     docstring guessed "most walkthroughs" and was wrong by an order of
     magnitude. It earns its place by costing nothing and never guessing.
  2. MODEL. One suggest.complete per batch — the mechanism. Handed the live
     vocabulary and told to reuse it. Same discipline as the idea tagger: the
     model proposes, _clean_tags decides.

WHY RUNG 1 IS SO SMALL HERE, since the number invites a fix that would be
worse: 423 of the 519 documents are per-session retros whose titles are
`2026-08-03 2133 vira` — a date, a time, a project. There is no substring in
that to match, and no cleverness recovers a subject that was never written
down. Those documents are tagged from a bounded excerpt of their opening prose
instead (see `excerpt`), which is read during the pass and never on a request.

Derived, therefore regenerable: the store is keyed by document id AND a hash of
what was read, so retitling a document re-tags it on the next pass. Owner
corrections live on the reading-list entry (`tags_add` / `tags_drop`), never
here — a correction written into a field the next pass rewrites is a correction
with a shelf life.
