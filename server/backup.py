"""Local backup rotation for the canonical, non-regenerable data in data/.
Everything else under data/ is a cache or index that rebuilds itself; these
are the real loss risk since data/ is git-ignored.

Covered: ideas.json (cross-session backlog), config.json (instance config),
subscriptions.json (curated merchant registry), routines.json (standing
agent loops), circuit-runs.json (circuit state), brief-journal.json (every
note told to Vira), atlas-groups.json (curated network groups),
jobs-log.json (the durable job ledger). The last five joined 2026-07-20
closing the external audit's P1-8 gap list (decision D5 bucket A).
applications.json (job-application owner state), mail-accounts.json (mail
account registry), and circuits.json (circuit definitions) joined
2026-07-21 (module-audit wave 1). evidence.json (Evidence Ledger case
studies — curated owner work, not regenerable) joined 2026-07-25. The
2026-08-10 data audit added seven more sole-copy files and the DIRS pass
below.

One dated snapshot per file per day into ~/.vira-backups/ (outside the
repo), keeping the newest 14 of each. DIRS get the same treatment as
dated directory copies (built under a .tmp name, then renamed, so a
half-copied tree is never mistaken for a snapshot). Runs at startup and
then daily from a daemon thread. Pure stdlib, never raises into the
caller.
