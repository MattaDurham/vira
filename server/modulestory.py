"""The build story behind a module — right-click a window, "What is this?".

Answers with the module registry's own description plus every document the
library holds about that surface: the films, plans, dossiers, retros and
briefs that chronicle how it was built. The owner's framing, from the day
the built-history library shipped: this stuff is the story of how everything
got built — and the module itself should be its front door.

Everything is DERIVED at read time — the blurb from modulemap, the documents
from readinglist + doctags, the film thumbs from walkthroughs — so the story
cannot drift from the stores it reads (the onboard.steps discipline). The one
curated thing here is WINDOWS: which doc-tag spellings and which registry
entry each window id means. Doc tags are model-minted on ideatags' module
axis, so the table names the spellings in use today; a tag the vocabulary
later converges differently simply stops matching and the panel reports the
thinner answer honestly, rather than any layer guessing.

Read-only; no store of its own; nothing here needs a passive guard.
