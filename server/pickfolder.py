"""A real folder picker — the OS's own open panel, not a path to type.

Vira runs on the owner's machine, so the honest way to ask "which folder?"
is to open the panel they already know: navigate, select, Open. Every
alternative a browser offers is worse:

  * `window.showDirectoryPicker()` opens a real panel and then deliberately
    withholds the filesystem path — Vira needs the path, so a handle is
    useless here.
  * `<input webkitdirectory>` gives a RELATIVE path (the folder name), and
    hands the page every file inside it.
  * "Paste the path" is the thing being replaced.

So the panel is opened SERVER-SIDE, the same trick `onboard.fda_assist`
uses: Vira is local, so a window it opens is a window on the owner's own
desk. This is the one place that is true — see WHEN NOT TO below.

WHEN NOT TO OPEN IT
-------------------
A panel on the owner's desktop is the correct answer only when the person
driving the browser is sitting at the machine running the server. Three
cases where that fails, all refused rather than half-served:

  * **demo mode** — a sandbox walkthrough must never put a real window on
    the real desktop (learned 2026-07-30, the whole reason `--demo` exists).
  * **a remote browser** — the phone over Tailscale. The caller passes
    `local=False` and gets `unavailable` with a reason, so the UI can fall
    back to the text field instead of popping a panel on a Mac nobody is
    looking at.

Callers must handle `unavailable`: this is an ENHANCEMENT over the text
field, never a replacement for it.
