"""Job descriptions — the posting, readable inside Vira.

The owner's question was "was there a reason why Anthropic job
descriptions couldn't open in a native Vira window?", and the honest
answer is no: the module had the text the whole time and never showed
it. A role's title was an `<a target="_blank">`, so reading what a job
actually said meant leaving Vira for the employer's own page — cookie
banner, trackers, apply widget — while `jobboards.py` had already pulled
the full description into the boards snapshot on its last sweep (up to
JD_CAP characters, for the scoring sessions to deep-read).

And what was stored could not have been rendered anyway. `_strip_html`
unescaped entities AFTER stripping tags, which is exactly backwards for
Greenhouse: its API escapes the description inside the JSON string, so
no tag matched the strip and the markup survived as literal text
(`<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong>...`).
Every other board fared no better — a real HTML body came out as one
10,000-character line with every paragraph and bullet gone.

So this module is two things:

- **`to_markdown()` — the one converter**, and the reason the panel
  reads like a document. It takes all three shapes the corpus holds
  (entity-escaped HTML, real HTML, already-flattened prose), keeps the
  headings and bullets a job description is MADE of, and hands the rest
  to `mailread.html_to_text`, which is the house structure-preserving
  html->text pass (`mail.strip_html`, its flattening sibling, is
  preview-only for the same reason `_strip_html` was). `jobboards`
  routes through it too, so from the next sweep the snapshot stores
  something a person — or a scoring session — could read.
- **`describe()` — the ladder**, cheapest first: the boards snapshot
  (already on disk: no network, and no visit to the employer's
  analytics), then a cached live fetch, then a live per-posting fetch
  for the ATSes that have a cheap one, then the blurb. Ashby publishes
  no single-posting endpoint (401; its board API is one 12MB document)
  and google/microsoft are search endpoints, so for those the snapshot
  IS the answer — and the payload says how old it is rather than
  implying Vira just checked.

This interface reads the connected sources:
reading a public job posting is not acting on anything.
