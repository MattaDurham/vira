"""Evidence Ledger — Vira's own build provenance, mined into interview-ready
case studies (problem -> how the owner directed the agent -> what shipped).

Two rungs, the find.py split:

  - mine() is RUNG 1: pure, deterministic, no model call. It parses session
    retros (~/TC-IL/Sessions/* vira.md and <repo>/retros/*.md), reads this
    checkout's git log, and reads the durable job ledger
    (data/jobs-log.json), then joins everything sharing a session's date
    into an EPISODE — raw material, not an audit. A missing retro source is
    dormant, with the reason named in status() (the frontdoor.py honesty
    rule), never an exception.

  - compose_episode() is RUNG 2: exactly ONE suggest.complete() call per
    episode, turning its raw material into a case study. The model's
    output is never trusted as-is — _clean_case validates it against the
    episode's own material before anything is saved: every citation must
    exactly match a retro filename, a commit sha, or a job id the episode
    actually carries, or it is DROPPED (never invented). This is the same
    grounded-or-held discipline as journal._pid_checker and
    resolver._grounded. Composing never auto-approves; a case starts as a
    draft the owner reviews.

Case studies are curated in data/evidence.json (draft -> approved ->
archived), editable in the UI, and exportable as clean plain text for
pasting into interview prep — a labeled block per case, ASCII punctuation
only (no markdown, no em-dashes).

No passive guard: mining is read-only (git log, file reads), and the store
write lands harmlessly in a test instance's cloned data/. compose_episode
spends model tokens the same way a reply draft does, and passive instances
already allow that class of call — so there is nothing here for
VIRA_PASSIVE to refuse.
