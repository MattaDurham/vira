"""Lesson recurrence — count how often each standing rule actually breaks.

The corrections ledger (~/.claude/LESSONS.md) is loaded into every session,
and nothing ever reads it back: when a later session re-learns a rule the
ledger already carries, the proposal pipeline drops the duplicate as ledger
hygiene, so the strongest recurrence signal is discarded. This module is
the read-back: match every session retrospective's reversal entries against
each standing rule, count how many DISTINCT SESSIONS have broken each rule
since it became active, and — once a tier-2 rule crosses the threshold —
stage ONE proposal in Vira's Queue describing the hook, test, or guard that
would make the mistake impossible. A tier-1 rule that recurs is a louder
finding: the mechanism did not hold (`guard_did_not_hold`).

Two rungs, the find.py split. RUNG 1 is deterministic and stands alone:
ledger parse, evidence gather (results JSON first, markdown retros as the
fallback), lexical + corpus-calibrated cosine scoring, and the verbatim
RESTATEMENT short-circuit — a later session independently proposing a rule
that is already on the ledger counts with no model at all. RUNG 2 is one
`suggest.complete` adjudication per rule per candidate batch, and every
`breaks: true` verdict must carry a quote that appears verbatim in that
candidate's text or it is demoted to false (the grounded-or-dropped
discipline of journal/_pid_checker, resolver._grounded, evidence).

TWO RULES THIS MODULE IS BENT AROUND:

1. VIRA NEVER WRITES THE LEDGER. lessons.py's own docstring: nothing
   enters that file automatically, because its lines change how every
   future session behaves. This module reads LESSONS.md and the two jsonl
   side stores and writes none of them — pinned by
   test_the_pass_never_writes_the_ledger. It also never proposes a tier-1
   LINE: tier 1 means a mechanism exists, and writing the line before the
   mechanism would make the ledger lie about its own enforcement (the
   branch-guard incident, 2026-07-29). The proposal is the WORK of
   building the mechanism, staged as a `proposed` idea behind the Queue's
   existing approval bar.

2. THE COUNTER MEASURES SUMMARIES, NOT GROUND TRUTH. Reversals are
   themselves model-written digests of sessions. The honest claim is "how
   often a session's own retrospective described something that reads as
   breaking this rule" — status() and every proposal say so.

Counting is DISTINCT SESSIONS, never evidence lines: one retro routinely
describes one incident across three bullets. Evidence is also deduped by
normalized text across sources (results -> session retros -> day retros),
because the day retro re-renders per-session bullets verbatim and each file
carries a different session key — without the text dedupe one incident
would count once per rendering.

Sections are cut with evidence.SECTION_RE over the RAW file text rather
than through evidence.parse_retro: that parser flattens each section body
to one whitespace-collapsed line (changelog._clean), which destroys the
bullet boundaries this module splits on. The section REGEX is shared so
the two cannot drift on what a heading is.

Store: data/lesson-recurrence.json (jsonstore discipline — fresh read,
locked mutate, atomic write). Derived and regenerable EXCEPT owner verdict
overrides (`owner: true`, never overwritten by a pass), rule dismissals,
and aliases — which is why the store is in the backup rotation.

The pass is read-only against files outside data/. Its one write — a
`proposed` idea — lands in this instance's store.
