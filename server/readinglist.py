"""The Reader's queue: everything worth reading, wherever it actually lives.

Vira generates a lot of documents — audit dossiers, plan-mode output, session
retros, morning briefs — and each one lands wherever its producing process puts
it. Before this they were scattered across as many surfaces as producers, and
the only cross-cutting thing anyone tracked was reading-room done-marks.

This module is the other half of the Reader: a registry of SOFT POINTERS. It
never copies a document and never becomes its home. An entry holds a title, a
kind, and a locator; resolving it is somebody else's job (a served URL for the
dossiers under static/, the vault for anything in the notes tree). If the
source file moves or is deleted, the entry reports `missing` and the queue
carries on — the registry is a view, not a store of record.

THE QUEUE IS ACTIVE WORK, NOT AN ARCHIVE. Marking a document read REMOVES it
from the queue (owner's call, 2026-07-27): "once I mark it complete, it is off
the list because it's still saved in all the places where they came from." The
entry is kept, with a `completed` stamp — both so the backfill sweep cannot
re-add something already read, and so a mistaken mark can be undone. It is
simply not in what `queue()` returns.

PROGRESS DEGRADES GRACEFULLY. A long document with section anchors reports
"9 of 14"; a document without them is one item you either have or have not read.
Section marks are NOT stored here — they reuse reading.py's per-list done store,
keyed by the entry's slug, so the cross-device behaviour and the 20k-key guard
come for free and there is exactly one implementation of "what have I read".

Same cross-process discipline as every other small JSON store: fresh read per
op, locked mutation, atomic write (server/jsonstore.py).
