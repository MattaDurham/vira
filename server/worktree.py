"""Branch-first enforcement for Vira-dispatched agent sessions.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the 2026-07-25 incident). A session dispatched from the
cockpit edited `static/index.html` straight in the live checkout, wrote half
a feature (the markup for folding Radar into People) and stopped before the
matching JavaScript. Nothing was wrong until the next restart — and then the
desktop came up with no dock, no layout button and a scrambled arrangement,
because `buildWindow()` hit `appendChild(null)` for a section that no longer
existed and took the rest of `initDesktop()` down with it.

The repo's own spec file already carried the branch-first rule in prose. The
session either never received that file (a worktree the app made itself is
not provisioned with it) or ignored it. So the lesson is NOT "say it louder":

    A rule the model has to remember is a rule that fails silently.
    Put the session somewhere it CANNOT damage, and verify the placement.

This module is the deterministic half. It answers two questions:

  is_branch_first(root)  — does this repo run the worktree workflow at all?
  ensure(root, slug)     — give me a worktree for it, making one if needed.
  tidy(...)              — and take it away again when it held nothing.

and provides the backstop the runner's permission gate uses:

  violates(path, live_root, worktree) — is this write aimed at the live tree
                                        when a worktree was assigned?

The guard is what makes this real. Placement alone is not enough, because an
agent can still write an absolute path into the live checkout; the gate turns
that into a denial with a message telling it where to go instead.
