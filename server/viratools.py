"""Native Vira tools for live agent sessions (the deep Vira connection).

A session Vira spawns knows nothing about its parent by default — a child
claude process inherits a prompt, a cwd, and env vars, not Vira's data
plane. This module closes that seam two ways:

- preamble(): appended to the SDK session system prompt (and prefixed to
  the legacy fallback prompt) so every session knows it runs inside Vira,
  what it can reach, and the house rule (never restart the server it
  lives inside).
- sdk_server(): an in-process SDK MCP server named "vira" exposing Vira's
  own data plane — calendar (local Calendar.sqlitedb + M365 Graph), the
  daily brief, CRM dossiers, mailbox search, iMessage threads, and the
  semantic media index — as first-class tools. Tool calls execute inside
  the Vira server process (the SDK routes them in-process; no subprocess,
  no localhost round-trip), so a session answers "do I have a doctor's
  appointment?" from the same code paths the Daily Brief renders.

Read-only by construction. The deliberate exceptions are enumerated ONCE,
in WRITE_TOOLS at the foot of this file — a prose count here drifted to
"TWO" while five had shipped, so the set is named where it is used and
nowhere else. Every one of them follows the same discipline: the model
PROPOSES a payload and a server-side validator schema-checks it and
applies it, so a malformed proposal is refused with a message written for
the model rather than landing on disk. propose_idea is the softest case
(it only appends to a STAGING queue the owner must approve); every other
tool renders text from existing loaders. That containment is why the
tools are auto-allowed in interactive sessions (no Approve/Deny
round-trip) — see session.Session.auto_allow.
