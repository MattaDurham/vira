"""Pivot reconnect — who in the dormant network is worth reactivating for
the active AI-role search, and why now.

The generic quiet/loops lists in brief.py and radar.py answer "who have I
neglected"; this module answers a narrower, career-shaped question: of the
people gone quiet, who sits closest to the companies and lanes the owner is
actually chasing right now? It is additive career-transition intelligence,
not a replacement for the relationship-maintenance lists.

Same two-rung shape as radar.py's groupings engine:

  1. Deterministic candidates — dormant/quiet CRM contacts scored against a
     PIVOT PICTURE (target companies, lanes, keywords) derived at runtime
     from the Applications universe. Nothing here is hardcoded to any
     particular company or role; the target picture is whatever the owner
     is currently chasing in Applications. Every point carries a reason.
  2. One AI curation pass picks the top 2-3 as "why them, why now" targets
     with a re-warming opener. A model outage falls back to the raw
     top-ranked candidates, honestly marked `curated: false`.

Cached in data/reconnect.json; dismissals persist and self-re-arm (the key
embeds the last-contact date, so a relationship that wakes up and goes
quiet again shows up as a fresh candidate). Dormant by construction when
the Applications universe is empty or absent — this module never invents
a target picture.
