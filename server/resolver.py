"""AI-assisted contact resolver for triage.

Given an unknown iMessage handle (and, when the enrichment merge already
minted one, its placeholder person_id) plus whatever the owner types into
the "Tell Vira" box, figure out the contact's real name. Three deterministic
evidence sources are gathered, then ONE model pass proposes a name. The
proposal is verified against the gathered evidence (grounded-or-held,
mirroring journal._pid_checker) and RETURNED — never written. The
Add-to-CRM flow is still the only thing that writes people.json.

Evidence sources
  (a) the handle's own thread   imessage.thread_for_person / triage._recent_inbound
  (b) the referral chain        a referrer named in the evidence/memory ->
                                crm.search_people -> the group they share with
                                the unknown handle (imessage.groups_for_person,
                                already carries resolved co-members, so this is
                                a filter, not new SQL) -> that group's messages
  (c) shared contact cards      media.person_media / media_for_chats docs ->
                                the .vcf body (full name + number are in it)

A referral is returned as a `fact` string; the Add route writes it via
crm.add_fact (source:"vira", which survives profile re-synthesis). `how_we_met`
is deliberately untouched — it is model-synthesized and not writable through
any durable path (see docs/data-map.md + PROFILE_EDITABLE_FIELDS).
