"""Idea tagging + similarity — the layer that makes the Queue searchable,
groupable, and self-aware about repetition.

The backlog was chronological and untyped: 135 ideas whose only axis was
the owner-curated `project`, so nothing could say "you had this idea
yesterday" and nothing could gather the six scattered Reader ideas into
one thing to decide about. This module adds the two derived layers that
answer both questions.

TWO RUNGS, the find.py split, and rung 1 stands on its own:

  1. DETERMINISTIC — text tokens and (when Ollama is up) one
     nomic-embed-text vector per idea. No model backend, no network past
     localhost. This alone powers similarity, the duplicate nudge on add,
     and the related-ideas block at dispatch. Ollama down degrades to
     token overlap and SAYS SO (`basis`), rather than quietly returning a
     thinner list that reads as "nothing is similar".
  2. TAGS — one `suggest.complete` pass per batch of ideas, over four
     axes beyond the owner's `project`: module, subproject, theme,
     concept. The model proposes; `_clean_tags` validates against the
     axis table and the shape rules before anything is stored, the
     update_module_map discipline.

THE VOCABULARY IS THE WHOLE POINT. Tagging each idea independently
produces "reader", "Reader", "reading-room" and "reader-queue" — four
tags for one subject, which groups nothing. Every tagging pass is handed
the vocabulary already in use and told to reuse it unless nothing fits,
so the tag set converges instead of fanning out.

DERIVED, THEREFORE REGENERABLE. `data/idea-index.json` is a sidecar
keyed by idea id and content hash: edit an idea's text and its tags and
vector are recomputed on the next pass. Nothing here is canonical, so it
is not in the backup rotation and deleting it costs only the recompute.
Owner corrections are the exception — they live on the idea record in
ideas.json (`tags_add` / `tags_drop`) and are overlaid at read time, the
contactcard.py pattern: a correction written into a derived field is a
correction with a shelf life.

# 186-idea backlog: eight genuinely new proposals were refused with rel
# 0.996-1.000, raw cosine 0.771-0.814 - including a backup restore-drill
# matched to "Daily Brief lane trust contracts" and a Murmur word-error-rate
# loop matched to the Murmur proper-noun lexicon.

    THE PASS USED TO RUN IN THE SERVER, and that is what made a background
    chore able to darken the whole app. CPython gives a process one
    interpreter: a thread doing Python work holds the GIL, and the event
    loop is just another contender for it. So `refresh()` on this thread —
    unpacking 144 float16 vectors, hashing every idea, scoring, serializing
    a 340KB sidecar — competed directly with uvicorn's ability to accept a
    connection or answer a request. Measured on the live instance
    2026-07-28: enough concurrent Python work and EVERY endpoint goes dark
    at once, async ones included, with the loop thread parked in the GIL
    wait (server/loopwatch.py carries the numbers).

    A child process has its own GIL. The pass can take as long as it likes
    and the server does not feel it — no throttle to tune, no fairness to
    get right, and no way for a future heavier pass to quietly become a
    stall again. The cost is a fork and an interpreter start per tick,
    every ten minutes, which is nothing next to the model call the pass
    makes anyway.

    Safe because the stores were already built for it: jsonstore's whole
    discipline is fresh-read-per-operation with mutations serialized
    through filelock, written for the detached job runners that share these
    same files (server/filelock.py). _update() is ideatags finally joining
    that discipline — without it, two processes racing a read-modify-write
    would silently lose one side's tags.
