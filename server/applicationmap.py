"""Application evidence map — role requirements to claim-safe material.

The Applications catalog owns the role and its stable uid.  Application
packages own the current resume, cover letter, answers, and interview prep.
The self-record owns professional claims, and the Evidence Ledger owns the
approved reusable build stories.  This module joins those sources at read
time.  Application-specific gap plans stay in Applications owner state and
are never promoted to evidence or copied into the self-record.

Everything is deterministic and local.  Similarity is deliberately described
as shared evidence language, not as a model's opinion that a requirement is
met.  The owner can therefore inspect every line behind every connection.

# The ONE table naming each lane's artifact files.  build() and the narrative
# reader consume it, and a DROPPED file is accepted through it as well
# (attach_material), so "what this lane is made of" and "what this lane will
# take" cannot drift apart.  Each entry is (root_globs, version_names): the
# .docx the package keeps at its top level, and the plain-text copy inside
# V<N>/ — which is the half a drop can write.
# The resume ships in two forms: the two-page record and a one-page companion
# distilled from it, told apart by a `_1p` suffix on an otherwise identical
# name. ONE rule, here, because two readers consume it — this lane and
# resumeview — and a second copy is a second chance for them to disagree about
# which file "the resume" means.
#
# The two-pager is the primary everywhere by EXCLUSION, never by sort order.
# `2026-08-14_cv_role.docx` does happen to sort before `..._role_1p.docx`
# ("." is 46, "_" is 95), and depending on that is exactly the accident the
# routinesrc backup names were bitten by.
#
# It is load-bearing beyond tidiness because `_read_artifact` takes the first
# candidate that yields NODES, not the first that exists: an empty or
# unreadable two-pager would fall straight through to the companion, and the
# Map would then map the distillation while reporting on the record. That is a
# silent substitution of a SUBSET for the whole, which is the one failure this

# ------------------------------------------------- taking a dropped document
#
# A lane reads "No connected material found" when the package's own artifact
# is absent or unreadable.  Dropping a markdown file on that lane is the
# owner saying "this belongs here", and the FILENAME decides what happens
# next — never a model:
#
#   * a name the lane already looks for is a RECONNECT.  The file was meant
#     to be in the package and was not found, so it is written where the map
#     reads from and the lane fills on the next build.  Deterministic,
#     immediate, no session.
#   * any other name is material Vira cannot place on its own.  NOTHING is
#     written until the owner confirms; then the file is staged in the
#     package's own inbox and a session is dispatched to fold it into the
#     canonical artifact.  A drag gesture must not silently start an agent
#     rewriting the owner's resume.
