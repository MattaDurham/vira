"""Group-chat profiles: a group thread as a first-class subject, with the
same depth as a person page.

Everything here except the brief is DETERMINISTIC — direct chat.db reads,
CRM joins, and a filter over the materialized atlas graph. The one AI pass
(`brief`) reads the room: dynamics, current threads, grounded reply
suggestions, live loops. It is cached per (group, latest message) in
data/group-briefs.json so reopening a quiet group costs nothing.

Group identity: chat.db carries several chat rows for one logical group
(SMS vs iMessage legs), so a group is addressed as a LIST of chat rowids,
merged the same way groups_for_person merges — identical member set +
display name. `resolve_group(chat_id)` goes from the one chat row a feed
item knows to the full merged group.

Sending: a reply goes to the LEG WHERE THE CONVERSATION IS — the chat row
with the newest message — addressed by its guid (send.send_to_group).

# WHAT THIS BOUNDS: the conversation the brief model SEES, and nothing
# else — the deterministic payload above is capped separately, for the
# client. Until 2026-08-28 it was two literals: THREAD_TAIL = 80 messages,
# each cut to 200 characters inside _brief_prompt. That is 16,000
# characters of a group's conversation, chosen once when the module was
# written and never compared against the window that had to hold it —
# the exact pattern server/modelbudget.py exists to end (define fed a
# model 9,000 characters against a backend reporting 1,000,000 tokens).
# Both halves are asked of the answering backend now.
#
# The class is "standard", and the honest version of why: somebody IS
# looking at this. The group panel renders immediately and this section
# spins ("Vira is reading the room…", loadBrief in app.js), so the read is
# not blocking but it is not unwatched either. What keeps it out of
# "interactive" is that neither half of the growth below is spent unless
# the conversation is really there: MSG_CHARS is a per-message CEILING,
# not a size, and the tail is a LIMIT on a chat.db read, so a short group
# composes the same small prompt it always did. Add the cache — a given
# group spins at most once per new message — and the latency the
# interactive ceiling exists to protect is not what binds here.
BRIEF_CLASS = "standard"
# The thread's share of that budget. The rest of the prompt is the member
# dossiers, the who-talks split, the graph edges and the related-group
# diffs — all deterministic, and all small beside the messages.
THREAD_SHARE = 0.6
# THE OLD LITERALS ARE THE REFERENCE SHAPE, NOT A FLOOR — thread_budget
# scales BOTH of them from here, so this pair is simply the point where
# that scale reads 1.0, and a thin backend goes below it. Measured
# 2026-08-28 against the per-provider floors: anthropic 245 x 614,
# openai 193 x 482, and a backend that reports nothing at all 35 x 120.
# That last one is the seam degrading downward on purpose: guessing high
# is the asymmetric error, since an over-large prompt is rejected or
# silently truncated by the provider and a truncation we did not perform
# is one we cannot report.
THREAD_TAIL = 80          # messages the brief read before the seam
MSG_CHARS = 200           # characters of each of them, before the seam
