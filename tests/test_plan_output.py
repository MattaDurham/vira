"""A plan is an OUTPUT SHAPE, not a permission mode.

Two things are pinned here. First, what makes a Flow step produce a plan
dossier: an Output part set to the plan destination (or the launchbar's own
choice on a Flow with no Output part), and the plan-format instruction that
reaches the step producing it — the renderer builds the dossier from that
structure, so an unstructured answer is a wall of prose with no hero, no
sections and no diagrams. Second, that none of it says anything about
permissions, which is the 2026-08-04 decoupling: publishing a plan and
denying writes used to be one flag, so a planning step could not search the
web or spawn a subagent purely because of what happened to its output.
