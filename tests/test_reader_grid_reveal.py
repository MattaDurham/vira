"""Regression contract for the Reader grid's scroll reveal.

The incident (2026-08-11): Vira's Documents in GRID view rendered a correct
count line above an empty page for several kind-filter combinations. Nothing
threw and every tile was built -- the section carried `opacity: 0` until an
IntersectionObserver granted it `rv`, and the observer asked for a RATIO
(`threshold: 0.12`).

A ratio threshold is unsatisfiable for an element taller than
`scrollport / threshold`. Measured on the real library: the flat-grouped
section ran 8,624px against a 639px scrollport -- a maximum achievable
intersection ratio of 0.074, so 12% could never be on screen at once and the
section stayed invisible forever. It was worse on a phone and in a small
window, because a shorter scrollport shrinks the achievable ratio further --
which is why only SOME filter combinations looked broken.

So this is not a style pin. The two facts below are a matched pair, and the
pairing is the invariant: while the CSS hides a section until `.rv`, whatever
grants `.rv` must not depend on how tall that section is. Assert the pair, or
a future ratio silently re-hides the library.
